Che provides a persistent home directory feature that allows each non-ephemeral workspace to have their /home/user directory be persisted across workspace restarts. You can enable this feature in the CheCluster by setting spec.devEnvironments.persistUserHome.enabled to true. For newly started workspaces, this feature creates a PVC mounted to the /home/user path of the tools container. In this documentation, a \"tools container\" will be used to refer to the first container in the devfile. This container is the container that includes the project source code by default. When the PVC is mounted for the first time, the persistent volume’s content are empty and therefore must be populated with the /home/user directory content. By default, the persistUserHome feature creates an init container for each new workspace pod named init-persistent-home. This init container is created with the tools container image and is responsible for running a stow command to create symbolic links in the persistent volume to populate the /home/user directory. For files that cannot be symbolically linked to the /home/user directory such as the .viminfo and .bashrc file, cp is used instead of stow. The primary function of the stow command is to run: stow -t /home/user/ -d /home/tooling/ --no-folding The command above creates symbolic links in /home/user for files and directories located in /home/tooling. This populates the persistent volume with symbolic links to the content in /home/tooling. As a result, the persistUserHome feature expects the tooling image to have its /home/user/ content within /home/tooling. For example, if the tools container image contains files in the home/tooling directory such as .config and .config-folder/another-file, stow will create symbolic links in the persistent volume in the following manner: Figure 1. Tools container with persistUserHome enabled The init container writes the output of the stow command to /home/user/.stow.log and will only run stow the first time the persistent volume is mounted to the workspace. Using the stow command to populate /home/user content in the persistent volume provides two main advantages: Creating symbolic links is faster and consumes less storage than creating copies of the /home/user directory content in the persistent volume. To put it differently, the persistent volume in this case contains symbolic links and not the actual files themselves. If the tools image is updated with newer versions of existing binaries, configs, and files, the init container does not need to stow the new versions, as the existing symbolic links will link to the newer versions in /home/tooling already. If the tooling image is updated with additional binaries or files, they won’t be symbolically linked to the /home/user directory since the stow command won’t be run again. In this case, the user must delete the /home/user/.stow_completed file and restart the workspace to rerun stow. persistUserHome tools image requirements The persistUserHome depends on the tools image used for the workspace. By default Che uses the Universal Developer Image (UDI) for sample workspaces, which supports persistUserHome out of the box. If you are using a custom image, there are three requirements that should be met to support the persistUserHome feature. The tools image should contain stow version >= 2.4.0. The $HOME environment variable is set to /home/user. In the tools image, the directory that is intended to contain the /home/user content is /home/tooling. Due to requirement three, the default UDI image for example adds the /home/user content to /home/tooling instead, and runs: RUN stow -t /home/user/ -d /home/tooling/ --no-folding in the Dockerfile so that files in /home/tooling are accessible from /home/user even when not using the persistUserHome feature.","title":"Persistent user home","component":"docs","version":"7.114.x","name":"about-persistent-user-home","url":"/docs/stable/administration-guide/about-persistent-user-home/","titles":[],"keyword":"administration guide, about, che, persistent, user, home"},"2":{"id":2,"text":"You can configure Kubernetes Ingress labels and annotations, if your organization requires them.

Development environment configuration options. Property Description Default allowedSources AllowedSources defines the allowed sources on which workspaces can be started. containerBuildConfiguration Container build configuration. containerResourceCaps ContainerResourceCaps defines the maximum resource requirements enforced for workspace containers. If a container specifies limits or requests that exceed these values, they will be capped at the maximum. Note: Caps only apply when resources are already specified on a container. For containers without resource specifications, use DefaultContainerResources instead. These resource caps do not apply to initContainers or the projectClone container. containerRunConfiguration Container run configuration. defaultComponents Default components applied to DevWorkspaces. These default components are meant to be used when a Devfile, that does not contain any components. defaultContainerResources DefaultContainerResources defines the resource requirements (memory/cpu limit/request) used for container components that do not define limits or requests. defaultEditor The default editor to workspace create with. It could be a plugin ID or a URI. The plugin ID must have publisher/name/version format.

The available deployment stragies are Recreate and RollingUpdate. With the Recreate deployment strategy, the existing workspace pod is killed before the new one is created. With the RollingUpdate deployment strategy, a new workspace pod is created and the existing workspace pod is deleted only when the new workspace pod is in a ready state. If not specified, the default Recreate deployment strategy is used. disableContainerBuildCapabilities Disables the container build capabilities. When set to false (the default value), the devEnvironments.security.containerSecurityContext field is ignored, and the following container SecurityContext is applied: containerSecurityContext: allowPrivilegeEscalation: true capabilities: add: - SETGID - SETUID disableContainerRunCapabilities Disables container run capabilities. Can be enabled on OpenShift version 4.20 or later. When set to false, the value from devEnvironments.security.containerSecurityContext is ignored, and instead the SecurityContext defined in devEnvironments.containerRunConfiguration.containerSecurityContext is applied. true editorsDownloadUrls EditorsDownloadUrls provides a list of custom download URLs for JetBrains editors in a local-to-remote flow. It is particularly useful in disconnected or air-gapped environments, where editors cannot be downloaded from the public internet. Each entry contains an editor identifier in the publisher/name/version format and the corresponding download URL. Currently, this field is intended only for JetBrains editors and should not be used for other editor types. gatewayContainer GatewayContainer configuration. ignoredUnrecoverableEvents IgnoredUnrecoverableEvents defines a list of Kubernetes event names that should be ignored when deciding to fail a workspace that is starting. This option should be used if a transient cluster issue is triggering false-positives (for example, if the cluster occasionally encounters FailedScheduling events). Events listed here will not trigger workspace failures. [ \"FailedScheduling\"] imagePullPolicy ImagePullPolicy defines the imagePullPolicy used for containers in a DevWorkspace. maxNumberOfRunningWorkspacesPerCluster The maximum number of concurrently running workspaces across the entire Kubernetes cluster. This applies to all users in the system. If the value is set to -1, it means there is no limit on the number of running workspaces. maxNumberOfRunningWorkspacesPerUser The maximum number of running workspaces per user. The value, -1, allows users to run an unlimited number of workspaces. maxNumberOfWorkspacesPerUser Total number of workspaces, both stopped and running, that a user can keep. The value, -1, allows users to keep an unlimited number of workspaces. -1 networking Configuration settings related to the workspaces networking. nodeSelector The node selector limits the nodes that can run the workspace pods. persistUserHome PersistUserHome defines configuration options for persisting the user home directory in workspaces. podSchedulerName Pod scheduler for the workspace pods. If not specified, the pod scheduler is set to the default scheduler on the cluster. projectCloneContainer Project clone container configuration. runtimeClassName RuntimeClassName specifies the spec.runtimeClassName for workspace pods. secondsOfInactivityBeforeIdling Idle timeout for workspaces in seconds. This timeout is the duration after which a workspace will be idled if there is no activity. To disable workspace idling due to inactivity, set this value to -1. 1800 secondsOfRunBeforeIdling Run timeout for workspaces in seconds. This timeout is the maximum duration a workspace runs. To disable workspace run timeout, set this value to -1. -1 security Workspace security configuration. serviceAccount ServiceAccount to use by the DevWorkspace operator when starting the workspaces. serviceAccountTokens List of ServiceAccount tokens that will be mounted into workspace pods as projected volumes. startTimeoutSeconds StartTimeoutSeconds determines the maximum duration (in seconds) that a workspace can take to start before it is automatically failed. If not specified, the default value of 300 seconds (5 minutes) is used. 300 storage Workspaces persistent storage. { \"pvcStrategy\": \"per-user\"} tolerations The pod tolerations of the workspace pods limit where the workspace pods can run. trustedCerts Trusted certificate settings. user User configuration. workspacesPodAnnotations WorkspacesPodAnnotations defines additional annotations for workspace pods. Table 2. allowedSources options. Property Description Default urls The list of approved URLs for starting Cloud Development Environments (CDEs). CDEs can only be initiated from these URLs. Wildcards are supported in URLs, allowing flexible matching for specific URL patterns. For instance, https://example.com/ would allow CDEs to be initiated from any path within 'example.com'. Table 3. containerBuildConfiguration options. Property Description Default openShiftSecurityContextConstraint OpenShift security context constraint to build containers. \"container-build\" Table 4. containerRunConfiguration options. Property Description Default containerSecurityContext SecurityContext applied to all workspace containers when run capabilities are enabled. The default procMount: \"Unmasked\" is set because the pod runs in a user namespace, which safely isolates the container’s /proc from the host. This allows the container to modify its own sysctl settings for configuring networking for nested containers. { \"allowPrivilegeEscalation\": true, \"capabilities\": { \"add\": [ \"SETGID\", \"SETUID\" ] }, \"procMount\": \"Unmasked\"} openShiftSecurityContextConstraint Specifies the OpenShift SecurityContextConstraint used to run containers. \"container-run\" workspacesPodAnnotations Extra annotations applied to all workspace pods, in addition to those defined in devEnvironments.workspacePodAnnotations.

Property Description Default externalTLSConfig External TLS configuration. Table 10. externalTLSConfig options. Property Description Default annotations Annotations to be applied to ingress/route objects when external TLS is enabled. enabled Enabled determines whether external TLS configuration is used. If set to true, the operator will not set TLS config for ingress/route objects. Instead, it ensures that any custom TLS configuration will not be reverted on synchronization. labels Labels to be applied to ingress/route objects when external TLS is enabled. Table 11. persistUserHome options. Property Description Default disableInitContainer Determines whether the init container that initializes the persistent home directory should be disabled. When the /home/user directory is persisted, the init container is used to initialize the directory before the workspace starts. If set to true, the init container will not be created. Disabling the init container allows home persistence to be initialized by the entrypoint present in the workspace’s first container component. This field is not used if the devEnvironments.persistUserHome.enabled field is set to false. The init container is enabled by default. enabled Determines whether the user home directory in workspaces should persist between workspace shutdown and startup. Must be used with the 'per-user' or 'per-workspace' PVC strategy in order to take effect. Disabled by default. Table 12. projectCloneContainer options. Property Description Default env List of environment variables to set in the container. image Container image. Omit it or leave it empty to use the default container image provided by the Operator. imagePullPolicy Image pull policy.

If set, defined values are merged into the default PodSecurityContext configuration. Table 14. storage options. Property Description Default perUserStrategyPvcConfig PVC settings when using the per-user PVC strategy. perWorkspaceStrategyPvcConfig PVC settings when using the per-workspace PVC strategy. pvcStrategy Persistent volume claim strategy for the Che server. The supported strategies are: per-user (all workspaces PVCs in one volume), per-workspace (each workspace is given its own individual PVC) and ephemeral (non-persistent storage where local changes will be lost when the workspace is stopped.) \"per-user\" Table 15. per-user PVC strategy options. Property Description Default claimSize Persistent Volume Claim size. To update the claim size, the storage class that provisions it must support resizing. storageAccessMode StorageAccessMode are the desired access modes the volume should have. It is used to specify PersistentVolume access mode type to RWO/RWX when using per-user strategy, allowing user to re-use volume across multiple workspaces. It defaults to ReadWriteOnce if not specified storageClass Storage class for the Persistent Volume Claim. When omitted or left blank, a default storage class is used. Table 16. per-workspace PVC strategy options. Property Description Default claimSize Persistent Volume Claim size. To update the claim size, the storage class that provisions it must support resizing. storageAccessMode StorageAccessMode are the desired access modes the volume should have. It is used to specify PersistentVolume access mode type to RWO/RWX when using per-user strategy, allowing user to re-use volume across multiple workspaces. It defaults to ReadWriteOnce if not specified storageClass Storage class for the Persistent Volume Claim. When omitted or left blank, a default storage class is used. Table 17. trustedCerts options. Property Description Default disableWorkspaceCaBundleMount By default, the Operator creates and mounts the 'ca-certs-merged' ConfigMap containing the CA certificate bundle in users' workspaces at two locations: '/public-certs' and '/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem'. The '/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem' directory is where the system stores extracted CA certificates for trusted certificate authorities on Red Hat (e.g., CentOS, Fedora). This option disables mounting the CA bundle to the '/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem' directory while still mounting it to '/public-certs'. gitTrustedCertsConfigMapName The ConfigMap contains certificates to propagate to the Che components and to provide a particular configuration for Git. See the following page: https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/deploying-che-with-support-for-git-repositories-with-self-signed-certificates/ The ConfigMap must have a app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org label.

The defaults roles are: - <che-namespace>-cheworkspaces-clusterrole - <che-namespace>-cheworkspaces-namespaces-clusterrole - <che-namespace>-cheworkspaces-devworkspace-clusterrole where the <che-namespace> is the namespace where the CheCluster CR is created. The Che Operator must already have all permissions in these ClusterRoles to grant them. debug Enables the debug mode for Che server. false deployment Deployment override options. extraProperties A map of additional environment variables applied in the generated che ConfigMap to be used by the Che server in addition to the values already generated from other fields of the CheCluster custom resource (CR). If the extraProperties field contains a property normally generated in che ConfigMap from other CR fields, the value defined in the extraProperties is used instead. logLevel The log level for the Che server: INFO or DEBUG. \"INFO\" proxy Proxy server settings for Kubernetes cluster. No additional configuration is required for OpenShift cluster. By specifying these settings for the OpenShift cluster, you override the OpenShift proxy configuration. Table 21. proxy options. Property Description Default credentialsSecretName The secret name that contains user and password for a proxy server. The secret must have a app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org label. nonProxyHosts A list of hosts that can be reached directly, bypassing the proxy. Specify wild card domain use the following form .<DOMAIN>, for example: - localhost - 127.0.0.1 - my.host.com - 123.42.12.32 Use only when a proxy configuration is required. The Operator respects OpenShift cluster-wide proxy configuration, defining nonProxyHosts in a custom resource leads to merging non-proxy hosts lists from the cluster proxy configuration, and the ones defined in the custom resources. See the following page: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html. In some proxy configurations, localhost may not translate to 127.0.0.1. Both localhost and 127.0.0.1 should be specified in this situation. port Proxy server port. url URL (protocol+hostname) of the proxy server. Use only when a proxy configuration is required. The Operator respects OpenShift cluster-wide proxy configuration, defining url in a custom resource leads to overriding the cluster proxy configuration.

The generated hostname follows this pattern: che-<che-namespace>.<domain>. The <che-namespace> is the namespace where the CheCluster CRD is created. In conjunction with labels, it creates a route served by a non-default Ingress controller. For a Kubernetes cluster, it contains a global ingress domain. There are no default values: you must specify them. hostname The public hostname of the installed Che server. ingressClassName IngressClassName is the name of an IngressClass cluster resource.

Following commands are available to collect Eclipse Che logs from the Kubernetes cluster using the chectl tool: chectl server:logs Collects existing Eclipse Che server logs and stores them in a directory on the local machine. By default, logs are downloaded to a temporary directory on the machine. However, this can be overwritten by specifying the -d parameter. For example, to download Che logs to the /home/user/che-logs/ directory, use the command chectl server:logs -d /home/user/che-logs/ When run, chectl server:logs prints a message in the console specifying the directory that will store the log files: Eclipse Che logs will be available in '/tmp/chectl-logs/1648575098344' If Eclipse Che is installed in a non-default namespace, chectl server:logs requires the -n <NAMESPACE> paremeter, where <NAMESPACE> is the Kubernetes namespace or OpenShift project in which Eclipse Che was installed.

Conversely when a node is being removed, ideally nodes that are running workspace pods should not be evicted by the autoscaler to avoid any interruptions while using the workspace and potentially losing any unsaved data. You need to make additional configurations to the Che installation to ensure proper workspace startup while a new node is being added.

While Network File System (NFS) is one of the few protocols that natively supports the necessary ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode for running concurrent workspaces (the Per-User strategy), standard Kubernetes NFS provisioning presents certain operational challenges: Quota Enforcement Failure: Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) cannot reliably enforce storage quotas on a generic NFS volume. This limitation means a single workspace could exceed its allocated storage, potentially consuming the entire shared volume and leading to resource exhaustion, which causes widespread instability for all other users. Stability and Concurrency: Generic NFS implementations often lack the robust locking and cache coherency required to maintain data integrity when multiple cluster nodes access the same volume concurrently, potentially leading to workspace instability. To overcome these stability and quota issues, it is recommended to use certified clustered or managed storage solutions that provide robust CSI drivers. These solutions use the NFS protocol but enforce enterprise-grade features, including strict quota enforcement and high-performance RWX file access, ensuring reliable operation for the Per-User strategy.

The following Go code starts a server on port 8080 and writes events to standard output: Example 1. main.go package main import ( \"io/ioutil\" \"net/http\" \"go.uber.org/zap\" ) var logger *zap.SugaredLogger func event(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /event\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /event\") } body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"err\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got event\") } func activity(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { switch req.Method { case \"GET\": logger.Info(\"GET /activity, doing nothing\") case \"POST\": logger.Info(\"POST /activity\") body, err := req.GetBody() if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error getting body\") return } responseBody, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body) if err != nil { logger.With(\"error\", err).Info(\"error reading response body\") return } logger.With(\"body\", string(responseBody)).Info(\"got activity\") } } func main() { log, _ := zap.NewProduction() logger = log.Sugar() http.HandleFunc(\"/event\", event) http.HandleFunc(\"/activity\", activity) logger.Info(\"Added Handlers\") logger.Info(\"Starting to serve\") http.ListenAndServe(\":8080\", nil) } Create a container image based on this code and expose it as a deployment in OpenShift in the eclipse-che namespace. The code for the example telemetry server is available at telemetry-server-example. To deploy the telemetry server, clone the repository and build the container: $ git clone https://github.com/che-incubator/telemetry-server-example $ cd telemetry-server-example $ docker build -t registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest . $ docker push registry/organization/telemetry-server-example:latest Both manifest_with_ingress.yaml and manifest_with_route contain definitions for a Deployment and Service. The former also defines a Kubernetes Ingress, while the latter defines an OpenShift Route. In the manifest file, replace the image and host fields to match the image you pushed, and the public hostname of your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Then run: $ kubectl apply -f manifest_with_[ingress|route].yaml -n eclipse-che For fast feedback when developing, it is recommended to do development inside a DevWorkspace. This way, you can run the application in a cluster and receive events from the front-end telemetry plugin. Maven Quarkus project scaffolding: mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.7.1.Final:create \\ -DprojectGroupId=mygroup -DprojectArtifactId=devworkspace-telemetry-example-plugin \\ -DprojectVersion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT Remove the files under src/main/java/mygroup and src/test/java/mygroup.

For more details on how to set configuration properties specific to your backend, see the Quarkus Configuration Reference Guide. Example 5. AnalyticsManager.java package org.my.group; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent; import javax.enterprise.inject.Alternative; import javax.inject.Inject; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.base.AbstractAnalyticsManager; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.base.AnalyticsEvent; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.finder.DevWorkspaceFinder; import org.eclipse.che.incubator.workspace.telemetry.finder.UsernameFinder; import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RestClient; import org.slf4j.Logger; import static org.slf4j.LoggerFactory.getLogger; @Dependent @Alternative public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { private static final Logger LOG = getLogger(AbstractAnalyticsManager.class); public AnalyticsManager(MainConfiguration mainConfiguration, DevWorkspaceFinder devworkspaceFinder, UsernameFinder usernameFinder) { super(mainConfiguration, devworkspaceFinder, usernameFinder); mainConfiguration.welcomeMessage.ifPresentOrElse( (1) (str) -> LOG.info(\"The welcome message is: {}\", str), () -> LOG.info(\"No welcome message provided\") ); } @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } @Override public void destroy() {} @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map<String, Object> properties) { LOG.info(\"The received event is: {}\", event); (2) } @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map<String, Object> properties) { } @Override public void onActivity() {} } 1 Log the welcome message if it was provided. 2 Log the event received from the front-end plugin. Since org.my.group.AnalyticsManager and org.my.group.MainConfiguration are alternative beans, specify them using the quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives property in src/main/resources/application.properties. Example 6. application.properties quarkus.arc.selected-alternatives=MainConfiguration,AnalyticsManager Set the DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT environment variable in the DevWorkspace. Here, the value is set to 4167. spec: template: attributes: workspaceEnv: - name: DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT value: '4167' Restart the DevWorkspace from the Eclipse Che dashboard. Run the following command within a DevWorkspace’s terminal window to start the application. Use the --settings flag to specify path to the location of the settings.xml file that contains the GitHub access token. $ mvn --settings=settings.xml quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=${DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT} The application now receives telemetry events through port 4167 from the front-end plugin. Verification steps Verify that the following output is logged: INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (Quarkus Main Thread) No welcome message provided INFO [io.quarkus] (Quarkus Main Thread) devworkspace-telemetry-example-plugin 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.7.2.Final) started in 0.323s.

The following output should be logged: INFO [io.qua.dep.dev.RuntimeUpdatesProcessor] (Aesh InputStream Reader) Live reload disabled INFO [org.ecl.che.inc.AnalyticsManager] (executor-thread-2) The received event is: Edit Workspace File in Che For the purposes of the example, this method always returns true whenever it is called. Example 7. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public boolean isEnabled() { return true; } It is possible to put more complex logic in isEnabled(). For example, the hosted Che Woopra backend checks that a configuration property exists before determining if the backend is enabled. onEvent() sends the event received by the backend to the telemetry system. For the example application, it sends an HTTP POST payload to the /event endpoint from the telemetry server. For the following example, the telemetry server application is deployed to OpenShift at the following URL: http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing, where apps-crc.testing is the ingress domain name of the OpenShift cluster. Set up the RESTEasy REST Client by creating TelemetryService.java Example 8. TelemetryService.java package org.my.group; import java.util.Map; import javax.ws.rs.Consumes; import javax.ws.rs.POST; import javax.ws.rs.Path; import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType; import javax.ws.rs.core.Response; import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient; @RegisterRestClient public interface TelemetryService { @POST @Path(\"/event\") (1) @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) Response sendEvent(Map<String, Object> payload); } 1 The endpoint to make the POST request to. Specify the base URL for TelemetryService in the src/main/resources/application.properties file: Example 9. application.properties org.my.group.TelemetryService/mp-rest/url=http://little-telemetry-server-che.apps-crc.testing Inject TelemetryService into AnalyticsManager and send a POST request in onEvent() Example 10. AnalyticsManager.java @Dependent @Alternative public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { @Inject @RestClient TelemetryService telemetryService; ... @Override public void onEvent(AnalyticsEvent event, String ownerId, String ip, String userAgent, String resolution, Map<String, Object> properties) { Map<String, Object> payload = new HashMap<String, Object>(properties); payload.put(\"event\", event); telemetryService.sendEvent(payload); } This sends an HTTP request to the telemetry server and automatically delays identical events for a small period of time. The default duration is 1500 milliseconds. Many telemetry systems recognize event duration. The AbstractAnalyticsManager merges similar events that happen in the same frame of time into one event. This implementation of increaseDuration() is a no-op. This method uses the APIs of the user’s telemetry provider to alter the event or event properties to reflect the increased duration of an event. Example 11. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void increaseDuration(AnalyticsEvent event, Map<String, Object> properties) {} Set an inactive timeout limit, and use onActivity() to send a WORKSPACE_INACTIVE event if the last event time is longer than the timeout. Example 12. AnalyticsManager.java public class AnalyticsManager extends AbstractAnalyticsManager { ... private long inactiveTimeLimit = 60000 * 3; ... @Override public void onActivity() { if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastEventTime >= inactiveTimeLimit) { onEvent(WORKSPACE_INACTIVE, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } } When destroy() is called, send a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event and shutdown any resources such as connection pools. Example 13. AnalyticsManager.java @Override public void destroy() { onEvent(WORKSPACE_STOPPED, lastOwnerId, lastIp, lastUserAgent, lastResolution, commonProperties); } Running mvn quarkus:dev as described in Running the application within a DevWorkspace and terminating the application with Ctrl+C sends a WORKSPACE_STOPPED event to the server. See the Quarkus documentation for the best instructions to package the application in a container. Build and push the container to a container registry of your choice. Example 14.

After startup, the editor checks for this environment variable, and if it is specified, takes the path to the extensions and installs it in the background without disturbing the user. Configuring default extensions is useful for installing .vsix extensions from the editor level. If you want to specify multiple extensions, separate them by semicolon. DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS='/projects/extension-1.vsix;/projects/extension-2.vsix' Read on to learn how to define the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS environment variable, including multiple examples of adding .vsix files to your workspace. There are three different ways to embed default .vsix extensions into your workspace: Put the extension binary into the source repository. Use the devfile postStart event to fetch extension binaries from the network. Include the extensions' .vsix binaries in the che-code image. Putting the extension binary into the source repository Putting the extension binary into the Git repository and defining the environment variable in the devfile is the easiest way to add default extensions to your workspace. If the extension.vsix file exists in the repository root, you can set the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS for a tooling container. Procedure Specify DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS in your .devfile.yaml as shown in the following example: schemaVersion: 2.3.0 metadata: generateName: example-project components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest env: - name: 'DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS' value: '/projects/example-project/extension.vsix' Using the devfile postStart event to fetch extension binaries from the network You can use cURL or GNU Wget to download extensions to your workspace. For that you need to: specify a devfile command to download extensions to your workpace add a postStart event to run the command on workspace startup define the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS environment variable in the devfile Procedure Add the values shown in the following example to the devfile: schemaVersion: 2.3.0 metadata: generateName: example-project components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest env: - name: DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS value: '/tmp/extension-1.vsix;/tmp/extension-2.vsix' commands: - id: add-default-extensions exec: # name of the tooling container component: tools # download several extensions using curl commandLine: | curl https://.../extension-1.vsix --location -o /tmp/extension-1.vsix curl https://.../extension-2.vsix --location -o /tmp/extension-2.vsix events: postStart: - add-default-extensions In some cases curl may download a .gzip compressed file. This might make installing the extension impossible. To fix that try to save the file as a .vsix.gz file and then decompress it with gunzip. This will replace the .vsix.gz file with an unpacked .vsix file. curl https://some-extension-url --location -o /tmp/extension.vsix.gz gunzip /tmp/extension.vsix.gz Including the extensions .vsix binaries in the che-code image. With default extensions bundled in the editor image, and the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS environment variable defined in the ConfigMap, you can apply the default extensions without changing the devfile. Following the steps below to add the extensions you need to the editor image. Procedure Create a directory and place your selected .vsix extensions in this directory. Create a Dockerfile with the following content: # inherit che-incubator/che-code:latest FROM quay.io/che-incubator/che-code:latest USER 0 # copy all .vsix files to /default-extensions directory RUN mkdir --mode=775 /default-extensions COPY --chmod=755 *.vsix /default-extensions/ # add instruction to the script to copy default extensions to the working container RUN echo \"cp -r /default-extensions /checode/\" >> /entrypoint-init-container.sh Build the image and then push it to a registry: $ docker build -t yourname/che-code:next . $ docker push yourname/che-code:next Add the new ConfigMap to the user’s namespace, define the DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS environment variable, and specify the absolute paths to the extensions.

One of DWO’s main responsibilities is to reconcile DevWorkspace custom resources (CR). The DevWorkspace CR is a Kubernetes resource representation of a Che workspace. Whenever a user creates a workspace using Che in the background, Dashboard Che creates a DevWorkspace CR in the cluster. For every Che workspace, there is an underlying DevWorkspace CR on the cluster. Figure 1 shows an example of a DevWorkspace CR in a cluster: Figure 1. Example of a DevWorkspace CR in a cluster When creating a workspace with Che with a devfile, the DevWorkspace CR contains the devfile details. Additionally, Che adds the editor definition into the DevWorkspace CR depending on which editor was chosen for the workspace. Che will also add attributes to the DevWorkspace which further configures the workspace depending on how you configured the CheCluster CR. A DevWorkspaceTemplate is a custom resource that defines a reusable spec.template for DevWorkspaces. When a workspace is started, DWO reads the corresponding DevWorkspace CR and creates the necessary resources such as deployments, secrets, configmaps, routes such that at the end a workspace pod representing the development environment defined in the devfile is created. Custom Resources overview The following Custom Resource Definitions are provided by the DevWorkspace Operator: DevWorkspace DevWorkspaceTemplate DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig DevWorkspaceRouting DevWorkspace The DevWorkspace custom resource contains details about an Che workspace. Notably, it contains devfile details and a reference to the editor definition. DevWorkspaceTemplate In Che the DevWorkspaceTemplate custom resource is typically used to define an editor (such as Visual Studio Code - Open Source) for Che workspaces. You can use this custom resource to define reusable spec.template content that is reused by multiple DevWorkspaces. DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig The DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig (DWOC) custom resource defines configuration options for the DWO. There are two different types of DWOC: global configuration non-global configuration The global configuration is a DWOC custom resource named devworkspace-operator-config and is usually located in the DWO installation namespace. By default, the global configuration is not created upon installation. Configuration fields set in the global configuration will apply to the DWO and all DevWorkspaces. However, the DWOC configuration can be overridden by a non-global configuration. Any other DWOC custom resource than devworkspace-operator-config is considered to be non-global configuration. A non-global configuration does not apply to any DevWorkspaces unless the DevWorkspace contains a reference to the DWOC. If the global configuration and non-global configuration have the same fields, the non-global configuration field takes precedence. Table 1. Global DWOC and Che-owned DWOC comparison Global DWOC Che-owned DWOC Resource name devworkspace-operator-config devworkspace-config Namespace DWO installation namespace Che installation namespace Default creation Not created by default upon DWO installation Created by default on Che installation Scope Applies to the DWO itself and all DevWorkspaces managed by DWO Applies to DevWorkspaces created by Che Precedence Overridden by fields set in Che-owned config Takes precedence over global config if both define the same field Primary use case Used to define default, broad settings that apply to DWO in general. Used to define specific configuration for DevWorkspaces created by Che For example, by default Che creates and manages a non-global DWOC in the Che namespace named devworkspace-config. This DWOC contains configuration specific to Che workspaces, and is maintained by Che depending on how you configure the CheCluster CR. When Che creates a workspace, Che adds a reference to the Che-owned DWOC with the controller.devfile.io/devworkspace-config attribute. Figure 2. Example of DevWorkspace configuration attribute DevWorkspaceRouting The DevWorkspaceRouting custom resource defines details about the endpoints of a DevWorkspace. Every DevWorkspace has its corresponding DevWorkspaceRouting object that specifies the workspace’s container endpoints. Endpoints defined from the devfile, as well as endpoints defined by the editor definition will appear in the DevWorkspaceRouting custom resource. apiVersion: controller.devfile.io/v1alpha1 kind: DevWorkspaceRouting metadata: annotations: controller.devfile.io/devworkspace-started: 'false' name: routing-workspaceb14aa33254674065 labels: controller.devfile.io/devworkspace_id: workspaceb14aa33254674065 spec: devworkspaceId: workspaceb14aa33254674065 endpoints: universal-developer-image: - attributes: cookiesAuthEnabled: true discoverable: false type: main urlRewriteSupported: true exposure: public name: che-code protocol: https secure: true targetPort: 3100 podSelector: controller.devfile.io/devworkspace_id: workspaceb14aa33254674065 routingClass: che status: exposedEndpoints: ...

These configurations are applied to any workspace you open. Once a workspace is started, the editor checks for this ConfigMap and stores configurations to the corresponding config files. The following sections are currently supported: settings.json extensions.json product.json configurations.json policy.json The settings.json section contains various settings with which you can customize different parts of the Code - OSS editor. The extensions.json section contains recommended extensions that are installed when a workspace is started. The product.json section contains properties that you need to add to the editor’s product.json file. If the property already exists, its value will be updated. The configurations.json section contains properties for Code - OSS editor configuration. For example, you can use the extensions.install-from-vsix-enabled property to disable Install from VSIX menu item in the Extensions panel. The extensions.install-from-vsix-enabled property disables only the UI action. Extensions can still be installed via the workbench.extensions.command.installFromVSIX API command or the CLI.

You can also point openVSXURL at the URL of a standalone Open VSX registry instance if its URL is accessible from within your organization’s cluster and not blocked by a proxy. You can manage Visual Studio Code extensions by setting up and using an internal, on-premises Open VSX registry. This approach provides full control over the extension lifecycle, enables offline use, and improves compliance. The embedded plugin registry will be deprecated in future releases, with the Open VSX registry serving as its successor. Refer to the Running the Open VSX On-Premises for detailed setup instructions. You can add or remove extensions in the embedded Open VSX registry instance. This results in a custom build of the Open VSX registry that can be used in your organization’s workspaces. To get the latest security fixes after a Che update, rebuild your container based on the latest tag or SHA.

Extract the <publisher> and <extension> name from the copied URL: https://open-vsx.org/extension/<publisher>/<name> If the extension is only available from Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace, but not Open VSX, you can ask the extension publisher to also publish it on open-vsx.org according to these instructions, potentially using this GitHub action. If the extension publisher is unavailable or unwilling to publish the extension to open-vsx.org, and if there is no Open VSX equivalent of the extension, consider reporting an issue to the Open VSX team.

Procedure In the Administrator view of the OpenShift web console, go to Operators → OperatorHub and search for Eclipse Che. Install the Eclipse Che Operator. See Installing from OperatorHub using the web console. The Eclipse Che Operator depends on the DevWorkspace Operator. If you install the Eclipse Che Operator manually to a non-default namespace, ensure that the DevWorkspace Operator is also installed in the same namespace. This is required as the Operator Lifecycle Manager will attempt to install the DevWorkspace Operator as a dependency within the Eclipse Che Operator namespace, potentially resulting in two conflicting installations of the DevWorkspace Operator if the latter is installed in a different namespace. If you want to onboard Web Terminal Operator on the cluster make sure to use the same installation namespace as Eclipse Che Operator since both depend on DevWorkspace Operator. Web Terminal Operator, Eclipse Che Operator, and DevWorkspace Operator must be installed in the same namespace.

Compared to fully separate \"real\" clusters, virtual clusters reuse worker nodes and networking of the host cluster. They have their own control plane and schedule all workloads into a single namespace of the host cluster. Similar to virtual machines, virtual clusters partition a single physical cluster into multiple separate ones. vCluster offers a solution for deploying Che in scenarios where it normally would be impossible. This includes situations where the Kubernetes cluster version is incompatible with Che, or when the cloud service provider lacks support for external OIDC.

Such a scale imposes high infrastructure demands and introduces potential bottlenecks that can impact the performance and stability of the entire system. Addressing these challenges requires meticulous planning, strategic architectural choices, monitoring, and continuous optimization to ensure a seamless and efficient development experience for a large number of users. CDE workloads are complex to scale mainly because the underlying IDE solutions, such as Visual Studio Code - Open Source (\"Code - OSS\") or JetBrains Gateway, are designed as single-user applications, not as multitenant services. Resource quantity and object maximums While there is no strict limit on the number of resources in a Kubernetes cluster, there are certain considerations for large clusters to remember OpenShift Container Platform, which is a certified distribution of Kubernetes, also provides a set of tested maximums for various resources, which can serve as an initial guideline for planning your environment: Resource type Tested maximum Number of nodes 2000 Number of pods 150000 Number of pods per node 2500 Number of namespace 10000 Number of services 10000 Number of secrets 80000 Number of config maps 90000 Table 1: OpenShift Container Platform tested cluster maximums for various resources. You can find more details on the OpenShift Container Platform tested object maximums in the official documentation. For example, it is generally not recommended to have more than 10,000 namespaces due to potential performance and management overhead. In Eclipse Che, each user is allocated a namespace. If you expect the user base to be large, consider spreading workloads across multiple \"fit-for-purpose\" clusters and potentially leveraging solutions for multi-cluster orchestration. Resource requirements When deploying Eclipse Che on Kubernetes, it is crucial to accurately calculate the resource requirements and determine memory and CPU / GPU needs for each CDE to come up with the right sizing of the cluster. In general, the CDE size is limited by and cannot be bigger than the worker node size. The resource requirements for CDEs can vary significantly based on the specific workloads and configurations. For example, a simple CDE might require only a few hundred megabytes of memory, while a more complex one will need several gigabytes of memory and multiple CPU cores. You can find more details about calculating resource requirements in the official documentation. Using etcd The primary datastore of Kubernetes cluster configuration and state is etcd. It holds the cluster state and configuration, including information about nodes, pods, services, and custom resources. As a distributed key-value store, etcd does not scale well past a certain threshold, and as the size of etcd grows, so does the load on the cluster, risking its stability. The default etcd size is 2 GB, and the recommended maximum is 8 GB. Exceeding the maximum limit can make the Kubernetes cluster unstable and unresponsive. Object size as a factor Not only the overall number, but also the size of the objects stored in etcd is a critical factor that can significantly impact its performance and stability. Each object stored in etcd consumes space, and as the number of objects increases, the overall size of etcd grows too. The larger the object is, the more space it takes in etcd. For example, etcd can be overloaded with just a few thousand of relatively big Kubernetes objects. Even though the data stored in a ConfigMap cannot exceed 1 MiB by design, a few thousand of relatively big ConfigMap objects can overload etcd storage. In the context of Eclipse Che, by default the Operator creates and manages the 'ca-certs-merged' ConfigMap, which contains the Certificate Authorities (CAs) bundle, in every user namespace. With a large number of TLS certificates in the cluster, this results in additional etcd usage. To disable mounting the CA bundle by using the ConfigMap under the /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem path, configure the CheCluster Custom Resource by setting the disableWorkspaceCaBundleMount property to true. With this configuration, only custom certificates will be mounted under the path /public-certs: spec: devEnvironments: trustedCerts: disableWorkspaceCaBundleMount: true DevWorkspace objects For large Kubernetes deployments, particularly those involving a high number of custom resources such as DevWorkspace objects, which represent CDEs, etcd can become a significant performance bottleneck. Based on the load testing for 6,000 DevWorkspace objects, storage consumption for etcd was approximately 2.5GB. Starting from DevWorkspace Operator version 0.34.0, you can configure a pruner that automatically cleans up DevWorkspace objects that were not in use for a certain period of time. To set the pruner up, configure the DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig object as follows: apiVersion: controller.devfile.io/v1alpha1 kind: DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig metadata: name: devworkspace-operator-config namespace: crw config: workspace: cleanupCronJob: enabled: true dryRun: false retainTime: 2592000 (1) schedule: “0 0 1 * *” (2) 1 By default, if a workspace was not started for more than 30 days it will be marked for deletion. 2 By default, the pruner will run once per month. OLMConfig When an Operator is installed by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), a stripped-down copy of its CSV is created in every namespace the Operator is configured to watch. These stripped-down CSVs are known as “Copied CSVs” and communicate to users which controllers are actively reconciling resource events in a given namespace. On especially large clusters, with namespaces and installed operators tending in the hundreds or thousands, Copied CSVs consume an unsustainable amount of resources; for example, OLM memory usage, cluster etcd limits, networking, etc. To eliminate the CSVs copied to every namespace, configure the OLMConfig object accordingly: apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1 kind: OLMConfig metadata: name: cluster spec: features: disableCopiedCSVs: true Additional information about the disableCopiedCSVs feature is available in its original enhancement proposal. The primary impact of the disableCopiedCSVs property on etcd is related to resource consumption. In clusters with a large number of namespaces and many cluster-wide Operators, the creation and maintenance of numerous Copied CSVs can lead to increased etcd storage usage and memory consumption. By disabling Copied CSVs, the amount of data stored in etcd is significantly reduced, which can help improve overall cluster performance and stability. This is particularly important for large clusters where the number of namespaces and operators can quickly add up to a significant amount of data. Disabling Copied CSVs can help reduce the load on etcd, leading to improved performance and responsiveness of the cluster. Additionally, it can help reduce the memory footprint of OLM, as it no longer needs to maintain and manage these additional resources. You can find more details about \"Disabling Copied CSVs\" in the official documentation. Cluster Autoscaling Although cluster autoscaling is a powerful Kubernetes feature, you cannot always fall back on it. You should always consider predictive scaling by analyzing load data on your environment to detect daily or weekly usage patterns. If your workloads follow a pattern and there are dramatic peaks throughout the day, you should consider provisioning worker nodes accordingly. For example, if you have a predictable load pattern where the number of workspaces increases during business hours and decreases during off-hours, you can use predictive scaling to adjust the number of worker nodes based on the expected load. This can help ensure that you have enough resources available to handle the peak load while minimizing costs during off-peak hours. Consider leveraging open-source solutions such as Karpenter for configuration and lifecycle management of the worker nodes. Karpenter can dynamically provision and optimize worker nodes based on the specific requirements of the workloads, helping to improve resource utilization and reduce costs. Multi-cluster By design, Eclipse Che is not multi-cluster aware, and you can only have one instance per cluster. However, you can run Eclipse Che in a multi-cluster environment by deploying Eclipse Che in each different cluster and using a load balancer or DNS-based routing to direct traffic to the appropriate instance based on the user’s location or other criteria. This approach can help improve performance and reliability by distributing the workload across multiple clusters and providing redundancy in case of cluster failures. Figure 1. Scheme of a multi-cluster environment You can test running Che in a multi-cluster by using the Developer Sandbox, a free trial environment by Red Hat with pre-configured tools and services. From an infrastructure perspective, the Developer Sandbox consists of multiple ROSA clusters. On each cluster, the productized version of Eclipse Che is installed and configured using Argo CD. Since the user base is spread across multiple clusters, workspaces.openshift.com is used as a single entry point to the productized Eclipse Che instances. You can find implementation details about the multicluster redirector in the following GitHub repository. The multi-cluster architecture of workspaces.openshift.com is part of the Developer Sandbox. It is a Developer Sandbox-specific solution that cannot be reused as-is in other environments. However, you can use it as a reference for implementing a similar solution well-tailored to your specific multicluster needs.","title":"Running Eclipse Che at scale","component":"docs","version":"7.114.x","name":"running-at-scale","url":"/docs/stable/administration-guide/running-at-scale/","titles":[],"keyword":"scale, infrastructure, workload, scalability, CDE, cloud"},"109":{"id":109,"text":"Follow the instructions below to deploy and configure an on-premises Eclipse Open VSX extension registry, fully integrated with Che and OpenShift environments. Choose one of the two setup paths: using a Che workspace or the OpenShift CLI (oc), to help you set up a secure, internal Open VSX instance. This includes creating necessary OpenShift project, deploying Open VSX components, publishing extensions and integrating the registry with Che. Prerequisites Be logged in as a cluster administrator. Procedure Start a workspace using the Open VSX repository. Create a workspace by using the following Eclipse Open VSX repository. The .devfile.yaml includes an elasticsearch component that does not support IBM Power (ppc64le) or IBM Z (s390x) architectures. To successfully start the workspace on these architectures, the only option is to remove this component from the devfile. Alternatively, you can refer to Using OpenShift CLI tool documentation, which describes how to run Open VSX separately without starting a workspace. The environment, including all necessary commands, is defined in the .devfile.yaml file. Create a new OpenShift project for Open VSX. Run 2.1. Create Namespace for OpenVSX task in the workspace (Terminal → Run Task… → devfile → 2.1. Create Namespace for OpenVSX). A new project with the name openvsx should be created on the cluster. Build and Publish Open VSX image. To build and deploy the Open VSX server container image to the OpenShift internal image registry, run the 2.2. Build and Publish Open VSX Image task in the workspace: (Terminal → Run Task… → devfile → 2.2. Build and Publish OpenVSX Image). During execution, you will be prompted to enter the Open VSX server version. If left blank, the task will default to using v0.27.0. Open VSX server versions could be found on the OpenVSX GitHub release page: https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/releases Build and Publish Open VSX CLI (ovsx) Image. Run 2.3. Build and Publish OpenVSX CLI Image task in the workspace (Terminal → Run Task… → devfile → 2.3. Build and Publish OpenVSX CLI Image) to build the Open VSX CLI image and push it to OpenShift internal registry. Deploy Open VSX. Run 2.4. Deploy OpenVSX task in the workspace (Terminal → Run Task… → devfile → 2.4. Deploy OpenVSX). This command deploys the Open VSX components to an OpenShift project by processing a template file (openvsx-deployment.yml). It creates all required resources defined in the template, which includes: Deployments (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Open VSX server, Open VSX CLI). Services and Routes for accessing components. Secrets for GitHub OAuth credentials and Open VSX personal access token. All deployment information is described in the deploy/openshift/openvsx-deployment.yml file with some default values such as OVSX_PAT_BASE64. Add Open VSX user with PAT to the database. Run the 2.5. Add OpenVSX user with PAT to the DB task in the workspace (Terminal → Run Task… → devfile → 2.5. Add OpenVSX user with PAT to the DB). The command will ask for the Open VSX username and user PAT.

If OVSX_PAT_BASE64 has been updated, use the new token’s decoded value as the user PAT. Configure Che to use the internal Open VSX. Run the 2.6. Configure Che to use the internal Open VSX registry task in the workspace (Terminal → Run Task… → devfile → 2.6. Configure Che to use the internal OpenVSX registry). It applies the patch to the CheCluster custom resource, updating its configuration to use the specified Open VSX URL for the extension registry. Publish an extension from a .vsix file. At the beginning, the Open VSX registry does not provide any extension. Once the openvsx-server pod is running and in the Ready state, extensions can be published to the registry. The 2.8. Publish a Visual Studio Code Extension from a VSIX file command publishes an extension to the local Open VSX registry directly from a .vsix file. It prompts you to provide the extension’s namespace name and the path to the .vsix file. Publish list of extensions. The 2.9. Publish list of Visual Studio Code Extensions command automates the process of publishing a predefined list of Microsoft Visual Studio Code extensions based on download URLs to the internal Open VSX registry. The command reads from the deploy/openshift/extensions.txt file, which lists the URLs of .vsix files for each extension to be published. To publish your extensions to Open VSX, update the extensions.txt file as needed, then run the 2.9. Publish list of Visual Studio Code Extensions task from the workspace: Terminal → Run Task… → devfile → 2.9. Publish list of Visual Studio Code Extensions. Verify that Che uses internal Open VSX. Start any workspace and check the available extensions in the Extensions view of the workspace IDE or by opening the internal route in the OpenVSX OpenShift project.

Get Open VSX sources and navigate to the OpenShift deploy directory: git clone https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx.git && cd openvsx/deploy/openshift Prepare Open VSX server image. The next step is to build and publish the Open VSX server image. To do this, run the following commands: export REGISTRY=quay.io && export NAMESPACE=myuser && export OPENVSX_SERVER_IMAGE_NAME=openvsx-server && export OPENVSX_VERSION=v0.27.0 && export OPENVSX_SERVER_IMAGE=${REGISTRY}/${NAMESPACE}/${OPENVSX_SERVER_IMAGE_NAME}:${OPENVSX_VERSION} && podman build -t \"${OPENVSX_SERVER_IMAGE}\" --build-arg \"OPENVSX_VERSION=${OPENVSX_VERSION}\" -f openvsx.Dockerfile . && podman login \"${REGISTRY}\" && podman push \"${OPENVSX_SERVER_IMAGE}\" Make sure to configure the correct container registry and namespace for your image. Additionally, ensure that the image is publicly accessible and can be pulled without authentication. Prepare Open VSX CLI image. Build and publish the Open VSX CLI image. To do this, run the following commands: export OPENVSX_CLI_IMAGE_NAME=openvsx-cli && export OPENVSX_CLI_VERSION=0.10.5 && export OPENVSX_CLI_IMAGE=${REGISTRY}/${NAMESPACE}/${OPENVSX_CLI_IMAGE_NAME}:${OPENVSX_CLI_VERSION} && podman build -t \"${OPENVSX_CLI_IMAGE}\" --build-arg \"OVSX_VERSION=${OPENVSX_CLI_VERSION}\" -f cli.Dockerfile . && podman push \"${OPENVSX_CLI_IMAGE}\" Ensure that the image is publicly accessible and can be pulled without authentication.

Publish Visual Studio Code extensions with the ovsx command. At the beginning, the Open VSX registry does not provide any extension. With everything configured, the next step is to publish a Visual Studio Code extension from inside the ovsx-cli container. To do this, you need two pieces of information: the extension namespace name (used for publishing), the download URL of the .vsix extension package. Once you have this information, run the following commands to publish the extension: Retrieve the name of the pod running the Open VSX server: export OVSX_POD_NAME=$(oc get pods -n openvsx -o jsonpath=\"{.items[*].metadata.name}\" | tr ' ' '\\n' | grep ^ovsx-cli) Download the .vsix extension: oc exec -n openvsx \"${OVSX_POD_NAME}\" -- bash -c \"wget -O /tmp/extension.vsix EXTENSION_DOWNLOAD_URL \" Create an extension namespace: oc exec -n openvsx \"${OVSX_POD_NAME}\" -- bash -c \"ovsx create-namespace EXTENSION_NAMESPACE_NAME\" || true Publish the extension: oc exec -n openvsx \"${OVSX_POD_NAME}\" -- bash -c \"ovsx publish /tmp/extension.vsix\" Delete the downloaded extension file: oc exec -n openvsx \"${OVSX_POD_NAME}\" -- bash -c \"rm /tmp/extension.vsix\" Example: Publish the redhat.vscode-yaml extension version 1.18.0: oc exec -n openvsx \"${OVSX_POD_NAME}\" -- bash -c \"wget -O /tmp/extension.vsix https://open-vsx.org/api/redhat/vscode-yaml/1.18.0/file/redhat.vscode-yaml-1.18.0.vsix \" && oc exec -n openvsx \"${OVSX_POD_NAME}\" -- bash -c \"ovsx create-namespace redhat\" || true && oc exec -n openvsx \"${OVSX_POD_NAME}\" -- bash -c \"ovsx publish /tmp/extension.vsix\" && oc exec -n openvsx \"${OVSX_POD_NAME}\" -- bash -c \"rm /tmp/extension.vsix\" Verify Open VSX extension registry. Check the list of published extensions by navigating to the URL defined in the OPENVSX_ROUTE_URL environment variable. In addition to using a public route to reference the Open VSX registry, you can also configure Che to set internal cluster service routing. This method provides enhanced security by keeping traffic confined within the cluster, avoiding public exposure. Procedure Steps for Internal Service Routing: Remove the Public Route. Delete the public route associated with the Open VSX registry to restrict external access: oc delete route internal -n openvsx Set the Internal Open VSX Service URL.

Eclipse Che runs on top of OpenShift, which provides the platform, and the foundation for the products functioning on top of it. OpenShift documentation is the entry point for security hardening. Project isolation in OpenShift In OpenShift, project isolation is similar to namespace isolation in Kubernetes but is achieved through the concept of projects. A project in OpenShift is a top-level organizational unit that provides isolation and collaboration between different applications, teams, or workloads within a cluster. By default, Che provisions a unique <username>-devspaces project for each user. Alternatively, the cluster administrator can disable project self-provisioning on the OpenShift level, and turn off automatic namespace provisioning in the CheCluster custom resource: devEnvironments: defaultNamespace: autoProvision: false With this setup, you achieve a curated access to Che, where cluster administrators control provisioning for each user and can explicitly configure various settings including resource limits and quotas. Learn more about project provisioning in the Provisioning namespaces in advance. Role-based access control (RBAC) By default, the Che operator creates the following ClusterRoles: <namespace>-cheworkspaces-clusterrole <namespace>-cheworkspaces-devworkspace-clusterrole The <namespace> prefix corresponds to the project name where the Eclipse Che CheCluster CR is located. The first time a user accesses Eclipse Che, the corresponding RoleBinding is created in the <username>-devspaces project. All resources and actions you can grant users permission to use in their namespace is listed below. Table 1. Overview of resources and actions available in a user’s namespace. Resources Actions pods \"get\", \"list\", \"watch\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"update\", \"patch\" pods/exec \"get\", \"create\" pods/log \"get\", \"list\", \"watch\" pods/portforward \"get\", \"list\", \"create\" configmaps \"get\", \"list\", \"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\" events \"list\", \"watch\" secrets \"get\", \"list\", \"create\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"delete\" services \"get\", \"list\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"update\", \"patch\" routes \"get\", \"list\", \"create\", \"delete\" persistentvolumeclaims \"get\", \"list\", \"watch\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"update\", \"patch\" apps/deployments \"get\", \"list\", \"watch\", \"create\", \"patch\", \"delete\" apps/replicasets \"get\", \"list\", \"patch\", \"delete\" namespaces \"get\", \"list\" projects \"get\" devworkspace \"get\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"list\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"watch\" devworkspacetemplates \"get\", \"create\", \"delete\", \"list\", \"update\", \"patch\", \"watch\" Each user is granted permissions only to their namespace, and can not access other user’s resources. Cluster administrators can add extra permissions to users. They should not remove permissions granted by default. Refer to the product documentation for configuring cluster roles for Eclipse Che users. More details about the role-based access control are available in the OpenShift documentation. Dev environment isolation Isolation of the development environments is implemented using OpenShift projects. Every developer has a project in which the following objects are created and managed: Cloud Development Environment (CDE) Pods, including the IDE server. Secrets containing developer credentials, such as a Git token, SSH keys, and a Kubernetes token. ConfigMaps with developer-specific configuration, such as the Git name and email. Volumes that persist data such as the source code, even when the CDE Pod is stopped. Access to the resources in a namespace must be limited to the developer owning it. Granting read access to another developer is equivalent to sharing the developer credentials and should be avoided. Enhanced authorization The current trend is to split an infrastructure into several \"fit for purpose\" clusters instead of having a gigantic monolith OpenShift cluster. However, administrators might still want to provide granular access, and restrict the availability of certain functionalities to particular users. A \"fit for purpose\" OpenShift cluster refers to a cluster that is specifically designed and configured to meet the requirements and goals of a particular use case or workload. It is tailored to optimize performance, resource utilization, and other factors based on the characteristics of the workloads it will be managing. For Eclipse Che, it is recommended to have this type of cluster provisioned. For this purpose, optional properties that you can use to set up granular access for different groups and users are available in the CheCluster Custom Resource: allowUsers allowGroups denyUsers denyGroups Below is an example of access configuration: networking: auth: advancedAuthorization: allowUsers: - user-a - user-b denyUsers: - user-c allowGroups: - openshift-group-a - openshift-group-b denyGroups: - openshift-group-c Users in the denyUsers and denyGroup categories will not be able to use Eclipse Che and will see a warning when trying to access the User Dashboard. Authentication Only authenticated OpenShift users can access Eclipse Che. The Gateway Pod uses a role-based access control (RBAC) subsystem to determine whether a developer is authorized to access a Cloud Development Environment (CDE) or not. The CDE Gateway container checks the developer’s Kubernetes roles. If their roles allow access to the CDE Pod, the connection to the development environment is allowed. By default, only the owner of the namespace has access to the CDE Pod. Access to the resources in a namespace must be limited to the developer owning it. Granting read access to another developer is equivalent to sharing the developer credentials and should be avoided. Security context and security context constraint Eclipse Che adds SETGID and SETUID capabilities to the specification of the CDE Pod container security context: \"spec\": { \"containers\": [ \"securityContext\": { \"allowPrivilegeEscalation\": true, \"capabilities\": { \"add\": [\"SETGID\", \"SETUID\"], \"drop\": [\"ALL\",\"KILL\",\"MKNOD\"] }, \"readOnlyRootFilesystem\": false, \"runAsNonRoot\": true, \"runAsUser\": 1001110000 } ] } This provides the ability for users to build container images from within a CDE. By default, Eclipse Che assigns a specific SecurityContextConstraint (SCC) to the users that allows them to start a Pod with such capabilities. This SCC grants more capabilities to the users compared to the default restricted SCC but less capability compared to the anyuid SCC. This default SCC is pre-created in the Che namespace and named container-build. Setting the following property in the CheCluster Custom Resource prevents assigning extra capabilities and SCC to users: spec: devEnvironments: disableContainerBuildCapabilities: true Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges are Kubernetes features you can use to help prevent bad actors and resource abuse within a cluster. Specifically, they allow you to set resource consumption constraints for pods and containers. By combining Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges, you can enforce project-specific policies to prevent bad actors from consuming excessive resources. These mechanisms contribute to better resource management, stability, and fairness within an OpenShift cluster. More details about Resource quotas and Limit ranges are available in the OpenShift documentation. Network policies Network policies provide an additional layer of security by controlling network traffic between pods in a Kubernetes cluster. By default, every pod can communicate with every other pod and service on the cluster, see OpenShift networking overview. Implementing network policies allows you to: Control ingress and egress traffic to and from workspace pods Limit the attack surface by denying unauthorized network access When configuring network policies for Eclipse Che, ensure that pods in the Che namespace can still communicate with pods in user namespaces, as this is required for proper functionality. For detailed instructions on implementing network policies with Eclipse Che, see Configuring network policies. Disconnected environment An air-gapped OpenShift disconnected cluster refers to an OpenShift cluster isolated from the internet or any external network. This isolation is often done for security reasons to protect sensitive or critical systems from potential cyber threats. In an air-gapped environment, the cluster cannot access external repositories or registries to download container images, updates, or dependencies. Eclipse Che is supported and can be installed in a restricted environment. Installation instructions are available in the official documentation. Managing extensions By default, Eclipse Che includes the embedded Open VSX registry which contains a limited set of extensions for the Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source editor. Alternatively, cluster administrators can specify a different plugin registry in the Custom Resource, for example https://open-vsx.org that contains thousands of extensions. They can also build a custom Open VSX registry. More details about managing IDE extensions are available in the official documentation. Installing extra extensions increases potential risks. To minimize these risks, make sure to only install extensions from reliable sources and regularly update them. Secrets Keep sensitive data stored as Kubernetes secrets in the users’ namespaces confidential (for example Personal Access Tokens (PAT), and SSH keys). Git repositories It is crucial to operate within Git repositories that you are familiar with and that you trust. Before incorporating new dependencies into the repository, verify that they are well-maintained and regularly release updates to address any identified security vulnerabilities in their code.","title":"Security best practices for Eclipse Che","component":"docs","version":"7.114.x","name":"security-best-practices","url":"/docs/stable/administration-guide/security-best-practices/","titles":[],"keyword":"security, best practices"},"111":{"id":111,"text":"The Che server components ensure multi-tenancy and workspaces management.

To do so, use the che-editor.yaml file. This file supports even a detailed IDE configuration. If you intend to start most or all of your organization’s workspaces with the same IDE other than Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source, an alternative is for the administrator of your organization’s Che instance to specify another supported IDE as the default IDE at the Che instance level. This can be done with .spec.devEnvironments.defaultEditor in the CheCluster Custom Resource. By using the che-editor.yaml file, you can set a common default IDE for your team and provide new contributors with the most suitable IDE for your project source code. You can also use the che-editor.yaml file when you need to set a different IDE default for a particular source code Git repository rather than the default IDE of your organization’s Che instance. Procedure In the remote Git repository of your project source code, create a /.che/che-editor.yaml file with lines that specify the relevant parameter. Verification Start a new workspace with a clone of the Git repository. Verify that the specified IDE loads in the browser tab of the started workspace. The simplest way to select an IDE in the che-editor.yaml is to specify the id of an IDE from the table of supported IDEs: Table 1.

Example 1. id selects an IDE from the plugin registry id: che-incubator/che-idea/latest As alternatives to providing the id parameter, the che-editor.yaml file supports a reference to the URL of another che-editor.yaml file or an inline definition for an IDE outside of a plugin registry: Example 2. reference points to a remote che-editor.yaml file reference: https://<hostname_and_path_to_a_remote_file>/che-editor.yaml Example 3. inline specifies a complete definition for a customized IDE without a plugin registry inline: schemaVersion: 2.1.0 metadata: name: JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Community IDE components: - name: intellij container: image: 'quay.io/che-incubator/che-idea:next' volumeMounts: - name: projector-user path: /home/projector-user mountSources: true memoryLimit: 2048M memoryRequest: 32Mi cpuLimit: 1500m cpuRequest: 100m endpoints: - name: intellij attributes: type: main cookiesAuthEnabled: true urlRewriteSupported: true discoverable: false path: /?backgroundColor=434343&wss targetPort: 8887 exposure: public secure: false protocol: https attributes: {} - name: projector-user volume: {} For more complex scenarios, the che-editor.yaml file supports the registryUrl and override parameters: Example 4. registryUrl points to a custom plugin registry rather than to the default Che plugin registry id: <editor_id> (1) registryUrl: <url_of_custom_plugin_registry> 1 The id of the IDE in the custom plugin registry.

For production purposes, it is recommended to use one of the Universal Base Images as a base image for defining the Cloud Development Environment. Some images can not be used as-is for defining Cloud Development Environment since Visual Studio Code - Open Source (\"Code - OSS\") can not be started in the containers with missing openssl and libbrotli.

As a result, if there is a workspace named my-workspace in the Che dashboard, there is a corresponding DevWorkspace custom resource named my-workspace in the user’s namespace on the cluster. Because each DevWorkspace custom resource on the cluster represents a Che workspace, you can manage Che workspaces by using Kubernetes APIs with clients such as the command-line kubectl. Each DevWorkspace custom resource contains details derived from the devfile of the Git repository cloned for the workspace. For example, a devfile might provide devfile commands and workspace container configurations. As a user, you can list your workspaces by using the command line. Prerequisites An active kubectl session with permissions to get the DevWorkspace resources in your namespace on the cluster. See Overview of kubectl. You know the relevant Che user namespace on the cluster. You can visit https://<che_fqdn>/api/kubernetes/namespace to get your Che user namespace as name. You are in the Che user namespace on the cluster. On OpenShift, you can use the command-line oc tool to display your current namespace or switch to a namespace.

Users with administrative permissions on the cluster can list all workspaces from all Che users by including the --all-namespaces flag. If your use case does not permit use of the Che dashboard, you can create workspaces with Kubernetes APIs by applying custom resources to the cluster. Creating workspaces through the Che dashboard provides better user experience and configuration benefits compared to using the command line: As a user, you are automatically logged in to the cluster. Kubernetes or OpenShift clients work automatically. Che and its components automatically convert the target Git repository’s devfile into the DevWorkspace and DevWorkspaceTemplate custom resources on the cluster. Access to the workspace is secured by default with the routingClass: che in the DevWorkspace of the workspace. Recognition of the DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig configuration is managed by Che. Recognition of configurations in spec.devEnvironments specified in the CheCluster custom resource including: Persistent storage strategy is specified with devEnvironments.storage. Default IDE is specified with devEnvironments.defaultEditor. Default plugins are specified with devEnvironments.defaultPlugins. Container build configuration is specified with devEnvironments.containerBuildConfiguration.

Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications. Integrate serverless capabilities (Technology Preview). Create workspaces to edit your application code using Che. Starting with OpenShift Container Platform 4.19, the perspectives in the web console have unified to simplify navigation, reduce context switching, streamline tasks, and provide users with a more cohesive OpenShift Container Platform experience. With this unified design, there is no longer a Developer perspective in the default view; however, all OpenShift Container Platform web console features are discoverable to all users. If you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission for certain features from the cluster owner. The Developer perspective can still be manually enabled if you prefer. The Getting Started pane in the web console provides resources such as, a tour of the console, information on setting up your cluster, a quick start for enabling the Developer perspective, and links to explore new features and capabilities. This section provides information about OpenShift Developer Perspective support for Che. When the Che Operator is deployed into OpenShift Container Platform 4.2 and later, it creates a ConsoleLink Custom Resource (CR).

To access the Red Hat Applications menu, click the three-by-three matrix icon on the main screen of the OpenShift web console. The Che Console Link, displayed in the drop-down menu, creates a new workspace or redirects the user to an existing one. OpenShift Container Platform console links are not created when Che is used with HTTP resources When installing Che with the From Git option, the OpenShift Developer Perspective console link is only created if Che is deployed with HTTPS. The console link will not be created if an HTTP resource is used. This section describes how to start editing the source code of applications running on OpenShift using Che. Prerequisites Che is deployed on the same OpenShift 4 cluster. Procedure Open the Topology view to list all projects. In the Select an Application search field, type workspace to list all workspaces. Click the workspace to edit. The deployments are displayed as graphical circles surrounded by circular buttons. One of these buttons is Edit Source Code. To edit the code of an application using Che, click the Edit Source Code button. This redirects to a workspace with the cloned source code of the application component.

Usually, you can fetch this URL by clicking on the Clone button in the SCM repository’s main page. Alternatively, you can copy the URL from the address bar of your browser when you are on the main page of the repository. Selecting a branch or a tag will add the reference parameter to the URL. For GitHub, you can also use a repository URL of a directory with a devfile, or a repository URL of the devfile. The name of the devfile must be devfile.yaml or .devfile.yaml. This feature is not supported for other Git providers. With Che, you can use a URL in your browser to start a new workspace that contains a clone of a Git repository. This way, you can clone a Git repository that is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or Microsoft Azure DevOps server instances. You can also use the Git Repository URL field on the Create Workspace page of your Che dashboard to enter the URL of a Git repository to start a new workspace. If you use an SSH URL to start a new workspace, you must propagate the SSH key. See Configuring DevWorkspaces to use SSH keys for Git operations for more information. If the SSH URL points to a private repository, you must apply an access token to be able to fetch the devfile.yaml content. You can do this either by accepting an SCM authentication page or following a Personal Access Token procedure. Configure personal access token to access private repositories. See Using a Git-provider access token. Prerequisites Your organization has a running instance of Che. You know the FQDN URL of your organization’s Che instance: https://<che_fqdn>.

Tuning can reduce this start time. Depending on the options, administrators or users can do the tuning. This section includes several tuning options for starting workspaces faster or improving workspace runtime performance. Caching images with Image Puller Role: Administrator When starting a workspace, Kubernetes pulls the images from the registry. A workspace can include many containers meaning that Kubernetes pulls Pod’s images (one per container). Depending on the size of the image and the bandwidth, it can take a long time. Image Puller is a tool that can cache images on each of Kubernetes nodes. As such, pre-pulling images can improve start times. See Caching images for faster workspace start. Choosing better storage type Role: Administrator and user Every workspace has a shared volume attached. This volume stores the project files, so that when restarting a workspace, changes are still available. Depending on the storage, attach time can take up to a few minutes, and I/O can be slow. Installing offline Role: Administrator Components of Che are OCI images. Set up Eclipse Che in offline mode to reduce any extra download at runtime because everything needs to be available from the beginning. See Installing Che in a restricted environment on OpenShift. Reducing the number of public endpoints Role: Administrator For each endpoint, Kubernetes is creating Kubernetes Ingress or OpenShift Route objects. Depending on the underlying configuration, this creation can be slow. To avoid this problem, reduce the exposure. For example, to automatically detect a new port listening inside containers and redirect traffic for the processes using a local IP address (127.0.0.1), Microsoft Visual Code - Open Source has three optional routes. By reducing the number of endpoints and checking endpoints of all plugins, workspace start can be faster. Providing enough CPU resources Plugins consume CPU resources. For example, when a plugin provides IntelliSense features, adding more CPU resources can improve performance. Ensure the CPU settings in the devfile definition, devfile.yaml, are correct: components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest cpuLimit: 4000m (1) cpuRequest: 1000m (2) 1 Specifies the CPU limit 2 Specifies the CPU request Providing enough memory Plug-ins consume CPU and memory resources. For example, when a plugin provides IntelliSense features, collecting data can consume all the memory allocated to the container. Providing more memory to the container can increase performance. Ensure that memory settings in the devfile definition devfile.yaml file are correct. components: - name: tools container: image: quay.io/devfile/universal-developer-image:ubi8-latest memoryLimit: 6G (1) memoryRequest: 512Mi (2) 1 Specifies the memory limit 2 Specifies the memory request","title":"Troubleshooting slow workspaces","component":"docs","version":"7.114.x","name":"troubleshooting-slow-workspaces","url":"/docs/stable/end-user-guide/troubleshooting-slow-workspaces/","titles":[{"text":"Improving workspace start time","hash":"improving-workspace-start-time","id":1},{"text":"Improving workspace runtime performance","hash":"improving-workspace-runtime-performance","id":2}],"keyword":"user-guide, troubleshooting-slow-workspaces"},"164":{"id":164,"text":"If you use Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source in a private browsing window, you might encounter the following error message: Error loading webview: Error: Could not register service workers.

If your administrator could not configure it for Che users, the workaround is for you to use a personal access token. You can configure personal access tokens on the User Preferences page of your Che dashboard: https://<che_fqdn>/dashboard/#/user-preferences?tab=personal-access-tokens, or apply it manually as a Kubernetes Secret in the namespace. Mounting your access token as a Secret enables the Che Server to access the remote repository that is cloned during workspace creation, including access to the repository’s /.che and /.vscode folders. Apply the Secret in your user namespace of the Kubernetes cluster of your organization’s Che instance. After applying the Secret, you can create workspaces with clones of private Git repositories that are hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, or Microsoft Azure Repos. You can create and apply multiple access-token Secrets per Git provider. You must apply each of those Secrets in your user namespace. Prerequisites You have logged in to the cluster. On OpenShift, you can use the oc command-line tool to log in to the cluster: $ oc login https://<che_fqdn> --username=<my_user> Procedure Generate your access token on your Git provider’s website. Personal access tokens are sensitive information and should be kept confidential. Treat them like passwords. If you are having trouble with authentication, ensure you are using the correct token and have the appropriate permissions for cloning repositories: Open a terminal locally on your computer Use the git command to clone the repository using your personal access token. The format of the git command vary based on the Git Provider. As an example, GitHub personal access token verification can be done using the following command: git clone https://<PAT>@github.com/username/repo.git Replace <PAT> with your personal access token, and username/repo with the appropriate repository path. If the token is valid and has the necessary permissions, the cloning process should be successful. Otherwise, this is an indicator of incorrect personal access token, insufficient permissions, or other issues. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud, verify that the token is authorized for use within the organization. Go to https://<che_fqdn>/api/user/id in the web browser to get your Che user ID.

Visit https://<che_fqdn>/api/kubernetes/namespace to get your Che user namespace as name. Switch to your Che user namespace in the cluster. On OpenShift: The oc command-line tool can return the namespace you are currently on in the cluster, which you can use to check your current namespace: $ oc project You can switch to your Che user namespace on a command line if needed: $ oc project <your_user_namespace> Apply the Secret. On OpenShift, you can use the oc command-line tool: $ oc apply -f - <<EOF <Secret_prepared_in_step_5> EOF If you are using Azure DevOps Server, you must also modify the workspace’s gitconfig with the following section: extraheader = \"Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded(:personal-access-token)>\" To generate the key-value pair, use the following command: echo -n \"extraheader = \\\"Authorization: Basic \"$(printf \":%s\" <personal access token> | base64)\\\" see the documentation page for more information. The extraheader configuration is needed for remote git operations to Azure Devops Server, for example git clone. This authorization method has a higher priority over the git credentials store, and as a result, the remote operations to other Git providers will fail.

OpenShift Connector is a GUI for the OpenShift Do (odo) utility, which aggregates OpenShift CLI (oc) commands into compact units. As such, OpenShift Connector helps new developers who do not have OpenShift background with creating applications and running them on the cloud. Rather than using several oc commands, the user creates a new component or service by selecting a preconfigured template, such as a Project, an Application, or a Service, and then deploys it as an OpenShift Component to their cluster.

Eclipse Che A developer platform for the cloud that provides an in-browser editor (IDE). You can enhance Che tools by adding development services, such as language servers, debug adapters, or IDEs packaged as containers. Visual Studio Code - Open Source The default editor component of a Che workspace. It is a Che-specific customization of the Visual Studio Code editor. You can enhance Visual Studio Code - Open Source with Visual Studio Code extensions. Che Workspace A container-based development environment managed by Eclipse Che. Every Che workspace is defined by a devfile. A Che workspace consists of an editor, runtime and build containers, and other development tools running inside containers. Editor A web application used as an editor in a workspace. Plugin Plugins are services that extend Che workspace capabilities. Che plugins are packaged as containers. Plugins are extensions of an editor or a service running in the container. Both Che plugins and editors are distributed through the Che plugins registry. Workspace A container-based development environment managed by Eclipse Che. Every Che workspace is defined by a devfile. A Che workspace consists of an editor, plugins, and runtime containers. Workspace runtime containers can be defined as simple container images or as Kubernetes or OpenShift resources. A Che workspace can be associated with source code projects hosted on a remote CVS server. A Che workspace can contain the definition of one or more commands such as run, build, or debug. Devfile A workspace configuration template. Use devfiles to create workspaces in the Dashboard. A devfile includes metadata such as scope, tags, components, description, name, and identification. Factory A template that contains the configuration to automate the generation of a new workspace using a factory identifier or a devfile added to the URL of the IDE. Use factories to create replicas of existing workspaces or to automate the provisioning of statically or dynamically defined workspaces. Project A source code repository.","title":"Che Glossary","component":"docs","version":"7.114.x","name":"che-glossary","url":"/docs/stable/glossary/che-glossary/","titles":[{"text":"Naming","hash":"_naming","id":1},{"text":"Terminology","hash":"_terminology","id":2}],"keyword":"overview, che-glossary"},"194":{"id":194,"text":"This section describes procedures to get started with Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat - https://workspaces.openshift.com Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat is an open source product based on Eclipse Che that is running on OpenShift Dedicated. The new service is part of the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift offering, and is using Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, which is built upon Eclipse Che and is optimized for Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Linux. Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is the product that is built from the Eclipse Che project. The product is normally two versions behind the project. Red Hat also provides licensing, packaging, and support, so Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is considered a more stable product than the upstream Eclipse Che project. See About Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat provides both Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces product-specific, as well as Eclipse Che community devfiles on the \"Get Started\" tab of the User Dashboard.

Community meetings Join us in the Che community meeting, available on-demand. Roadmap See the development roadmap on the wiki. Eclipse Che is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform. As an open source project, the core goals of Eclipse Che are to: Accelerate project and developer onboarding: As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, Eclipse Che makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project. Remove inconsistency between developer environments: No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment. Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness: As Eclipse Che becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines. To achieve those core goals, Eclipse Che provides: Workspaces: Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications. Browser-based IDEs: Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tools, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more. Extensible platform: Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plugins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. Enterprise Integration: Multiuser capabilities with OIDC authentication. Che defines the workspace to be the project code files and all the dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. Che treats the IDE and the development runtime as dependencies of the workspace. These items are embedded and always included with the workspace. This differentiates Che from classical workspace definitions, which can include the project code, but require the developer to bind their IDE to their workstation and use it to provide a runtime locally. Workspaces are isolated from one another and are responsible for managing the lifecycle of their components. Developers using Eclipse Che use their containers directly in their developer workspaces. Che workspaces are Kubernetes or OpenShift Pods, which allow to replicate the application runtimes (and its microservices) used in production and provide a “developer mode” layer on top of those, adding intelligent code completion and IDE tools. An enterprise integration using OpenShift OAuth or Dex. Every Eclipse Che user gets a centralized developer workspace that can be easily defined, administered, and managed. As a Kubernetes-native application, Eclipse Che provides state-of-the-art monitoring and tracing capabilities, integrating with Prometheus and Grafana.
