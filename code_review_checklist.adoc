# Pull Request review checklist for committers and reviewers
:toc: auto

The reviewer validates the content of a Pull Request with this checklist.

## Automated validation steps

These automated steps block the pull request merge.

* [ ] *`Build and validate PR / link checker (pull_request)`* is successful
** [ ] *`Build using Antora`* step is successful: documentation is building without warnings, and all AsciiDoc attributes have a definition.
** [ ] *`Validate links using htmltest`* step is successful: internal and external links are valid.
** [ ] *`Validate language on files added or modified`* step is successful and reports no vale errors: basic language validation, no major deviations from link:https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ibm-style/9780132118989/[IBM Style Guide] and link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/[Supplementary Style Guide], and project specific language rules.
* [ ] *`eclipsefdn/eca`*  is successful: all contributors have signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA).

## Non automated validation steps

The author and the reviewers validate the content of a pull request with this additional checklist:

* Any procedure:
** [ ] Successfully tested.
* Any page or link rename:
** [ ] The page contains a redirection for the previous URL.
** Propagate the URL change in:
*** [ ] Dashboard [default branding data](https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-dashboard/blob/main/src/services/bootstrap/branding.constant.ts)
*** [ ] Chectl [constants.ts](https://github.com/che-incubator/chectl/blob/master/src/constants.ts)
* [ ] Builds on https://workspaces.openshift.com[Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat].
* [ ] *`Validate language on files added or modified`* step reports no vale warnings.
