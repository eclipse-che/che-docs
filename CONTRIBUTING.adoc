[id="documentation-workflow"]
== The documentation workflow

.Procedure
. Contributor submits a code pull request in one of the Che repositories with a `status/doc-impact` label.

. The author of the code pull request, or the reviewer ensures the code pull request contains a reference to a documentation pull request for the `main` branch of the `che-docs` repository:

.. The author of the code pull request, or the reviewer provides a documentation pull request that the members of the documentation team can merge without further editing.

.. Or, the author of the code pull request, or the reviewer provides at least an initial draft of the content and reaches out to the documentation-team members for assistance with editing, to help finalize the documentation pull request.

.. Or, the author of the code pull request, or the reviewer reaches out to the members of the documentation team and work with them on submitting a documentation pull request.

. xref:reviewing-a-documentation-pull-request[Review the documentation pull request].

. Merge the code pull request into the `che` repository, for next milestone `x.y.z`.

. Merge the documentation content for next milestone `x.y.z` into the `main` branch of the `che-docs` repository.

. Release `che` milestone `x.y.z`.

. Navigate to the preview: open _Preview_.

. Open created and changed files, and examine the _Problems Panel_ to validate the language.
Toggle the view of the _Problems Panel_ using the _View > Problems_ menu entry.

. To merge the content, open a pull request to the default `+main+` branch.

. When you intend to review a pull request, assign yourself in the GitHub pull request view.

. Review the pull request.
See xref:reviewing-a-documentation-pull-request[Reviewing a documentation pull request].

. The documentation pull request needs a review by the documentation team and by engineering.

. The continuous integration process is publishing content after the merge in the release branch.

.Verification steps
* Navigate to the publication URL of Eclipse Che Documentation: link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/[] and search for your changes.

[id="creating-a-page"]
== Creating a page

Create a link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/page/[page] and add it to the navigation when:

* It is meaningful to have a navigation entry
* The content might receive link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-id/[cross-references].
Avoid cross-references to a page link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-id/#id-fragment[fragment].

.Procedure
. Define the page destination directory __<pages_directory>__.
It can be:
+
* `modules/administration-guide/pages/`
* `modules/end-user-guide/pages/`

. Define the page title, and the page file name: use lower case and separate words with dashes `__<title>__.adoc`.
The directory and the file name determine the page URL.

. Copy one of the templates in the `templates/pages` directory to `__<pages_directory>__/__<title>__.adoc`.
+
* link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/pages/assembly.adoc[Assembly page template]
* link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/pages/concept.adoc[Concept page template]
* link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/pages/procedure.adoc[Procedure page template]
* link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/pages/reference.adoc[Reference page template]

. Add a cross-reference to the page in the `modules/__<guide_name>__/nav.adoc` navigation file to create the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/navigation/xrefs-and-link-text/#default-link-text[navigation entry].
+
[source,asciidoc,subs="+quotes"]
----
* xref:__<file_name>__.adoc[]
----

. Verify that an AsciiDoc attribute defines the content type.
The page content type can be:

* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#forming-assemblies[:_content-type: ASSEMBLY]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-concept-modules[:_content-type: CONCEPT]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-procedure-modules[:_content-type: PROCEDURE]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-reference-modules[:_content-type: REFERENCE]


. Edit the Antora metadata in the file.
+
.Template metadata for a page
====
[subs="+attributes,quotes"]
----
:description: A description of the page stored in an HTML meta tag.
:keywords: comma-separated values, stored, in an HTML, meta, tag
:navtitle: Title
:page-aliases:

[id="title"]
= Title
----
====

. Author the content.

[id="creating-a-partial"]
== Creating a partial

Create a link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/partials-and-content-snippets/[partial] and add it to an assembly page when:

* The content is a concept, procedure or reference to include in a page.
* The content might not receive cross-references.

.Procedure
. Copy one of the templates in the `templates/partials` directory to `modules/__<guide_name>__/partials/__<lowercase_title>__.adoc`.
+
* link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/partials/concept.adoc[Concept partial template]
* https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/partials/procedure.adoc[Procedure partial template]
* https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/partials/reference.adoc[Reference partial template]

. Verify that an AsciiDoc attribute defines the content type.
The partial content type can be:

* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-concept-modules[:_content-type: CONCEPT]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-procedure-modules[:_content-type: PROCEDURE]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-reference-modules[:_content-type: REFERENCE]

. Add an include statement in the corresponding page in `modules/__<guide_name>__/pages/`:
+
[source,asciidoc,subs="+quotes"]
----
\include::partial$__<file_name>__.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
----

. Edit the metadata in the file.
+
[source,asciidoc,subs="+attributes,quotes"]
----
[id="title"]
= Title
----

. Author the content.

[id="adding-a-contextual-example"]
== Adding an example specific to the project context

Create an link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/examples-and-source-snippets/[example] specific to the project context when:

* Upstream and downstream require a different content.
* The content is a block of text.
* Using an AsciiDoc attribute is not an option.

The include statement contains the `project-context` attribute to ensure upstream and downstream use a different file.
These link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#using-text-snippets[snippets] have no content type.

.Procedure
. Create the file `modules/__<guide_name>__/examples/snip_che___<lowercase_title>__.adoc`, and author the content.

. Add an include statement in the corresponding page `templates` directory to `modules/__<guide_name>__/pages/__<title>__.adoc`.
+
[source,asciidoc,subs="+quotes"]
----
\include::example$snip_{project-context}__<file_name>__.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
----

. Author the content.

[id="adding-an-image"]
== Adding an image

Avoid using images unless necessary.

.Procedure
. Add the image to the `+modules/__<guide_name>__/images/+` directory corresponding to the guide including the image.

. To publish a block image, use the following syntax.
See link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/block-images/[Antora documentation - Add block images] and link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images/[Asciidoctor documentation - Images].
+
.Block image
====
----
.__<Image caption>__
image::__<image_name>__.png[__<Image title>__]
----
====

. The publication tool resizes images.
To provide a link to a full-size image, add a `link` attribute:
+
.Block image with a link to the full-size image
====
----
.__<Image caption>__
image::__<image_file_name>__[__<Image title>__,link="../_images/__<image_file_name>__"]
----
====

[id="using-special-characters"]
== Using special characters

.Procedure
* To exclude special characters from markup substitutions, use the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/pass/pass-macro/#custom-substitutions[inline `pass` macro].
+
.Displaying a variable name containing underscores
====
----
pass:a,c,m[VARIABLE_NAME__WITH__UNDERSCORES]
----

Result::
pass:a,c,m[VARIABLE_NAME__WITH__UNDERSCORES]
====

== Building and validating Documentation on a local environment
