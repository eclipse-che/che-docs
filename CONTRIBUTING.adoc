[id="documentation-workflow"]
== The documentation workflow

.Procedure

pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.write = NO -->]

. Contributor submits a code pull request in one of the Che repositories with a `status/doc-impact` label.

. The author of the code pull request or the reviewer ensures the code pull request contains a reference to a documentation pull request for the `master` branch of the `che-docs` repository:

.. The author of the code pull request or the reviewer provides a documentation pull request that the members of the documentation team can merge without further editing.

.. Or, the author of the code pull request or the reviewer provides at least an initial draft of the content and reaches out to the documentation-team members for assistance with editing, to help finalizing the documentation pull request.

.. Or, the author of the code pull request or the reviewer reaches out to the members of the documentation team and work with them on submitting a documentation pull request.

. xref:reviewing-a-documentation-pull-request[Review the documentation pull request].

. Merge the code pull request into the `che` repository, for next milestone `x.y.z`.

. Merge the documentation content for next milestone `x.y.z` into the `master` branch of the `che-docs` repository. 

. Release `che` milestone `x.y.z`.

[id="creating-a-page"]
== Creating a page

Create a link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/[page] and add it to the navigation when it is meaningful to have a navigation entry, or when it may receive link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-id/[cross references]. Avoid cross references to a page link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/page-id/#id-fragment[fragment]. The file name determines the page URL. Therefore an AsciiDoc attribute defines the content type, rather than a file name prefix. 
The page content type can be:

* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#forming-assemblies[:_content-type: ASSEMBLY]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-concept-modules[:_content-type: CONCEPT]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-procedure-modules[:_content-type: PROCEDURE]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-reference-modules[:_content-type: REFERENCE]

.Procedure

. Copy one of the templates in the `templates/pages` directory to `modules/__<guide_name>__/pages/__<lowercase_title>__.adoc`.
+
* link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/pages/assembly.adoc[Assembly page template]
* link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/pages/concept.adoc[Concept page template]
* https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/pages/procedure.adoc[Procedure page template]
* https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/pages/reference.adoc[Reference page template]

. Add a cross reference to the page in the `modules/__<guide_name>__/nav.adoc` navigation file to create the link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/navigation/xrefs-and-link-text/#default-link-text[navigation entry].
+
.Navigation entry
====
[subs="+attributes,quotes"]
----
* xref:__<file_name>__.adoc[]
----
====

. Edit the metadata in the file.
+
.Template metadata for a page
====
[subs="+attributes,quotes"]
----
:description: A description of the page stored in an HTML meta tag.
:keywords: comma-separated values, stored, in an HTML, meta, tag
:navtitle: Title
// :page-aliases:

[id="title_{context}"]
= Title
----
====

. Author the content.


[id="creating-a-partial"]
== Creating a partial

Create a link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/partials-and-content-snippets/[partial] and add it to an assembly page when it may not receive cross references. For consistency with the pages, an AsciiDoc attribute defines the content type.
The partial content type can be:

* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-concept-modules[:_content-type: CONCEPT]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-procedure-modules[:_content-type: PROCEDURE]
* link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#creating-reference-modules[:_content-type: REFERENCE]

.Procedure

. Copy one of the templates in the `templates/partials` directory to `modules/__<guide_name>__/partials/__<lowercase_title>__.adoc`.
+
* link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/partials/concept.adoc[Concept partial template]
* https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/partials/procedure.adoc[Procedure partial template]
* https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/templates/partials/reference.adoc[Reference partial template]

. Add an include statement in the corresponding page `modules/__<guide_name>__/pages/__<title>__.adoc`:
+
.Include statement to a partial, in a page
====
`pass:a,c,m[include::partial$__<file_name>__.adoc[leveloffset=+1]]`
====

. Edit the metadata in the file.
+
.Template metadata for a partial
====
[subs="+attributes,quotes"]
----
[id="title_{context}"]
= Title
----
====

. Author the content.


[id="adding-a-contextual-example"]
== Adding a contextual example

Create a contextual link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/examples-and-source-snippets/[example] when upstream and downstream need a different content. The include statement contains the `project-context` attribute to ensure upstream and downstream use a different file.
These link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#using-text-snippets[snippets] have no content type.

.Procedure

. Create an empty file `modules/__<guide_name>__/examples/snip_che___<lowercase_title>__.adoc`.

. Add an include statement in the corresponding page `templates` directory to `modules/__<guide_name>__/pages/__<title>__.adoc`.
+
====
`pass:a,c,m[include::example$snip_{project-context_}__<file_name>__.adoc[leveloffset=+1]]`
====

. Author the content.


[id="adding-an-image"]
== Adding an image

Avoid using images unless necessary.

.Procedure

. Add the image to the `+modules/__<guide_name>__/images/+` directory corresponding to the guide including the image.

. To publish a block image, use the following syntax. See link:https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/block-images/[Antora documentation - Add block images] and link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images/[Asciidoctor documantation - Images].
+
.Block image
====
----
.__<Image caption>__
image::__<image_name>__.png[__<Image title>__]
----
====

. The publication tool resizes images. To provide a link to a full-size image, add a `link` attribute:
+
.Block image with a link to the full size image
====
----
.__<Image caption>__
image::__<image_file_name>__[__<Image title>__,link="../_images/__<image_file_name>__"]
----
====

[id="using-special-characters"]
== Using special characters

.Procedure

* To exclude special characters from markup  substitutions, use the link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/pass/pass-macro/#custom-substitutions[inline `pass` macro]. 
+
.Displaying a variable name containing underscores
====
----
pass:a,c,m[VARIABLE_NAME__WITH__UNDERSCORES]
----
Result::
pass:a,c,m[VARIABLE_NAME__WITH__UNDERSCORES]
====
