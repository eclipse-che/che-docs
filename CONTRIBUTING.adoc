= Contributing to the Eclipse Che Documentation

== Understanding Che Documentation ecosystem

* Please read the link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[Code of conduct].

* Eclipse Che documentation project follows a forking workflow. To learn more, read https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow[Forking Workflow]. 

* Eclipse Che documentation follows the _IBM Style Guide_. If you do not have a paper copy of the styleguide, see the
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/styleguidelines/index.html[developerWorks editorial style guide] on the IBM website. While developerWorks is no longer maintained, it still provides useful reference information.

* To learn more about the tool validating the style, see the https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/[`+vale+` documentation].

* Eclipse Che documentation uses AsciiDoc for markup. To learn more about AsciiDoc syntax, see the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc Writer’s Guide].

* The Eclipse Che documentation project follows guidelines from the
https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/[Modular Documentation Initiative]. As Antora is using the term of _module_ with a different acceptation, this project is refering to them as _topics_. To understand the nature of topics, see the https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#modular-docs-terms-definitions[Appendix A: Modular Documentation Terms and Definitions].

* Eclipse Che documentation uses Jekyll to build the documentation.

* To learn more about the `+newdoc+` tool generating the topic
templates, see https://github.com/mrksu/newdoc[`+newdoc+` documentation].

* To learn more about the `+test-adoc+` tool validating the topic files, see the https://github.com/jhradilek/check-links[`+test-adoc+`documentation].

* To learn more about Hosted Che, see the
https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/hosted-che/[Hosted Che documentation].

== Editing and submitting new content

.Procedure

. Open a che-docs workspace running on Hosted Che: `++https++://che.openshift.io/factory?url=https://github.com/__<github-handle>__/che-docs/__<branch-name>__/tree/`

. Create a branch `__<branch-name>__` for your work.

. Edit the content.

. Build and validate the new content. See: xref:building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che[].

. To merge the content, open a pull request. Submit the pull request against the default `+master+` branch. Specify as much information as possible in the PR template.

. To review the pull request: validate the accuracy of content, as well as build, language, links and modular docs requirements. See: xref:building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che[].

. The continuous integration process is publishing content once merged in the `+master+` publication branch.

.Verification steps

* Navigate to the publication URL of Eclipse Che Documentation: link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/[] and search for your changes.


[id="building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che"]
== Building and validating the documentation using Che

To build the Eclipse Che documentation from a Che workspace.

.Prerequisites

* Open a Che workspace containing a fork of the documentation. See xref:editing-and-submitting-new-content[].

.Procedure

. Open _My Workspace_.

. To process generated documentation: Open _User Runtimes / bash-curl / Generate reference tables_.

. To build the documentation and start the preview server: open _User Runtimes / che-docs-dev / Start preview server_.

. To validate the language of the files currently open, look at the _Problems_ panel in the _Bottom Panel_. To toggle the view of this panel use the _View > Problems_ menu entry.

. To validate the compliance of an asciidoc file with Modular Documentation guidelines: 

.. In the _Explorer_, right-click on file to validate and select _Copy Path_.

.. Open _User Runtimes / che-docs-dev / Validate Modular Doc_.

.. In the _Validate Modular Doc_ panel in the _Bottom Panel_, paste the path of the file to validate.

.. The tool `+test-adoc+` tests the file and produces some output.

. To validate all links: open _User Runtimes / linkchecker / Validate links_.


[id="creating-a-new-topic-using-che"]
== Creating a new topic using Che

To create a new topic using a Che workspace:

.Procedure

. Open _My Workspace_.
. Open _User Runtimes / tools / Create a new topic_.
. Choose the target guide among the available guides:
+
* `+overview+`: introductory section
* `+end-user-guide+`: documentation for developers: navigating
dashboard, working in Che-Theia, and so on
* `+installation-guide+`: installation guides
* `+administration-guide+`: documentation for administrators of the
clusters: configuring Che on a cluster, managing users, monitoring
resources, security and data recovery
* `+contributor-guide+`: how to develop plug-ins for Che, add new
debuggers, languages, and so on
* `+extensions+`: documentation about extensions for Che, such as
Eclipse Che4z, OpenShift Connector.

. Choose the topic nature:
+
* `+assembly+`
* `+concept+`
* `+procedure+`
* `+reference+`

. Enter the title for the new topic.

.Verification steps

. The file is generated in the `+src/main/pages-che-7/<guide_name>/+` directory and the script displays related information.



== Adding images

.Procedure

. Add images to one of the subdirectories in the `+src/main/che/docs/images/+` directory. Create a new subdirectory if none of the existing ones fits the new image.

. To publish an image, use the following syntax:
+
....
image::directory/img.png[alt text]
....
+
Images are sized automatically. You can provide a URL to a full-size image, as well as a caption and alt text:
+
....
.Click to view a larger image
[link=che/docs/images/devel/js_flow.png
image::devel/js_flow.png[Alt text]
....

Do not post too many images unless it is absolutely necessary. Animated `+.gif+` images are preferred, especially when explaining how to use complex UI features.

== Using special characters

* To prevent special characters from being interpreted as formatting mark-up, use pass-through macros. 
+
.To escape underscores, asterisks, or backticks, use:
====
....
pass:[VARIABLE_NAME__WITH__UNDERSCORES]
....
====

== Building and validating Documentation on a local environment

This section describes how to build and validate the documentation on a local environment.

WARNING: This is not the preferred method. For the supported method, see: xref:building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che[].

.Prerequisites:

* A running installation of link:http://podman.io[podman] or link:http://docker.io[docker].

* An installation of 
https://errata-ai.gitbook.io/vale/getting-started/installation[vale].

* An installation of https://github.com/linkchecker/linkchecker[linkchecker].


.Procedure

. To build documentation locally, run:
+
----
$ bash run.sh
----

. Navigate to `+localhost:4000+` in your browser.

. To create a new topic using, run following command:
+
----
$ bash ./tools/newtopic.sh
----

. To validate the compliance of an Asciidoc file with Modular Documentation standards, execute following command from a `+bash+` terminal, from the root directory of the project:
+
----
$ bash ./tools/test-adoc.sh <PATH_TO_THE_FILE>
----

. To validate compliance of a file with the style guide, execute following command in a terminal, from the root directory of the project:
+
----
$ vale <PATH_TO_THE_FILE>"
----

. To validate links, execute following command in a terminal, from the root directory of the project:
+
----
$ linkchecker -f linkcheckerrc  http://0.0.0.0:4000/
----
