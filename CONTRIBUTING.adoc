[id="documentation-workflow"]
== The documentation workflow

.Procedure

. Contributor submits a code pull request in one of the Che repositories with a `status/doc-impact` label.

. The author of the code pull request or the reviewer ensures the code pull request contains a reference to a documentation pull request for the `master` branch of the `che-docs` repository:

.. The author of the code pull request or the reviewer provides a complete documentation pull request that can then be merged by the members of the documentation team without further editing.

.. Or, the author of the code pull request or the reviewer provides at least an initial draft of the content and reaches out to the documentation-team members for assistance with editing, so that the documentation pull request can be finalized.

.. Or, the author of the code pull request or the reviewer reaches out to the members of the documentation team and work with them on submitting a documentation pull request.

. Review the documentation pull request. See xref:editing-submitting-and-reviewing-new-content[].

. Merge the code pull request into the `che` repository, for next milestone `x.y.z`.

. The documentation pull request, validated, stays in the queue in the `che-docs` repository. 

. Release `che` milestone `x.y.z`.

. Merge the documentation content for milestone `x.y.z` into the `master` branch of the `che-docs` repository. 

. Publish the `che-docs` `master` branch to https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs.


[id="editing-submitting-and-reviewing-new-content"]
== Editing, submitting and reviewing new content

.Prerequisites

* A fork of the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/[] project, accessible at the following URL, where `__<organization>__` is your GitHub organization or username: `++https++://github.com/__<organization__/che-docs/`. See link:https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo[Fork a repository].

.Procedure

. Open a che-docs workspace running on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat: `++https++://workspaces.openshift.com/f?url=https://github.com/__<organization>__/che-docs/`. 

. Create a branch `__<branch-name>__` for your work.

. Edit the content.

. Build and validate the new content. See: xref:building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che[].

. To merge the content, open a pull request. Submit the pull request against the default `+master+` branch. Specify as much information as possible in the pull request template.

. When you intend to review a pull request, click Assignees in the GitHub pull request view. This indicates you are the reviewer and avoids duplication of efforts.

. To review the pull request:

.. Validate the accuracy of content, as well as build, language, links and modular docs requirements.

.. For documentation updates containing testable steps, the documentation pull request needs to have the `team/che-qe` label set and get reviewed by both the documentation team and the Che QA team.

.. For documentation updates not containing testable steps, the documentation pull request needs to get reviewed by the documentation team.

.. For more information, see xref:building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che[].

. The continuous integration process is publishing content once merged in the `+master+` publication branch.

.Verification steps

* Navigate to the publication URL of Eclipse Che Documentation: link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/[] and search for your changes.


[id="building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che"]
== Building and validating the documentation using Che

To build the Eclipse Che documentation from a Che workspace, follow the steps below.

.Prerequisites

* Open a Che workspace containing a fork of the documentation. See xref:editing-submitting-and-reviewing-new-content[].

.Procedure

. To build the documentation and start the preview server: open _My Workspace / User Runtimes / che-docs / Start preview server_.

. To navigate to the preview, open _Preview_.

. To validate the links: open _User Runtimes / che-docs / Validate links_.

. To validate the language changes: open _My Workspace / User Runtimes / che-docs / Validate language changes_.

. To validate the language of the currently open files, look at the _Problems_ tab in the _Bottom Panel_. To toggle the view of this tab use the _View > Problems_ menu entry.

. To validate the compliance of an AsciiDoc file with Modular Documentation guidelines:

.. In the _Explorer_, right-click on file to validate and select _Copy Path_.

.. Open _My Workspace / User Runtimes / che-docs / Validate Modular Doc_.

.. In the _Validate Modular Doc_ panel in the _Bottom Panel_, paste the path of the file to validate.

.. The tool `+test-adoc+` tests the file and produces some output.



[id="creating-a-new-topic-using-che"]
== Creating a new topic using Che

To create a new topic using a Che workspace:

.Procedure

. Open _My Workspace_.
. Open _User Runtimes / tools / Create a new topic_.
. Choose the target guide among the available guides:
+
* `+overview+`: introductory section
* `+end-user-guide+`: documentation for developers: navigating
dashboard, working in Che-Theia, and so on
* `+installation-guide+`: installation guides
* `+administration-guide+`: documentation for administrators of the
clusters: configuring Che on a cluster, managing users, monitoring
resources, security and data recovery
* `+contributor-guide+`: how to develop plug-ins for Che, add new
debuggers, languages, and so on
* `+extensions+`: documentation about extensions for Che, such as
Eclipse Che4z, OpenShift Connector.

. Choose the topic nature:
+
* `+assembly+`
* `+concept+`
* `+procedure+`
* `+reference+`

. Enter the title for the new topic.

.Verification steps

. The file is generated in the `+src/main/pages-che-7/<guide_name>/+` directory and the script displays related information.


== Adding images

.Procedure

. Add images to one of the subdirectories in the `+src/main/che/docs/images/+` directory. Create a new subdirectory if none of the existing ones fits the new image.

. To publish an image, use the following syntax:
+
....
image::directory/img.png[alt text]
....
+
Images are sized automatically. You can provide a URL to a full-size image, as well as a caption and alt text:
+
....
.Click to view a larger image
[link=che/docs/images/devel/js_flow.png
image::devel/js_flow.png[Alt text]
....

Do not post too many images unless it is absolutely necessary. Animated `+.gif+` images are preferred, especially when explaining how to use complex UI features.

== Using special characters

* To prevent special characters from being interpreted as formatting mark-up, use pass-through macros. 
+
.To escape underscores, asterisks, or backticks, use:
====
....
pass:[VARIABLE_NAME__WITH__UNDERSCORES]
....
====

== Building and validating Documentation on a local environment using the `che-docs` container

This section describes how to build and validate the documentation on a local environment.

WARNING: This is not the preferred method. For the supported method, see: xref:building-and-validating-the-documentation-using-che[].

.Prerequisites:

* A running installation of link:http://podman.io[podman] or link:http://docker.io[docker].

.Procedure

. Open a terminal into the project directory, and build the documentation using and instance of the `che-docs` container:
+
----
$ ./tools/runnerpreview.sh
---- 

. Navigate to `+localhost:4000+` in your browser.

. Open a second terminal, and attach to the running `che-docs` container. Run all following steps from this context.
+
----
$ podman exec -ti che-docs  bash
----

. To validate links, run:
+
----
$ htmltest
----

. To validate language on changed files, run:
+
----
$ ./tools/validate_language_changes.sh
----

. To create a new topic using templates, run following command:
+
----
$ ./tools/newtopic.sh
----

. To validate the compliance of an AsciiDoc file with Modular Documentation standards, run:
+
----
$ ./tools/test-adoc.sh <PATH_TO_THE_FILE>
----
