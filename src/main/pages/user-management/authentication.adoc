[id="authentication-on-che-master"]
== Authentication on Che Master

[id="openid"]
=== OpenId

OpenId authentication on Che master, implies presence of an external OpenId provider and has 2 main steps:

1.  Authenticate the user through the JWT token he brought or redirect him to login;
+
(Authentication tokens should be send in a `Authorization` header. Also, in limited cases when it’s not possible to use `Authorization` header, token can be send in `token` query parameter. An example of such exceptional case can be: OAuth authentification initialization, IDE shows javadoc in iframe where authentication must be initialized.)
2.  Compose internal "subject" object which represents the current user inside of the Che master code.

At the time of writing the only supported/tested OpenId provider is Keycloak, so all examples/links will refer to this implementation.

The flow starts from the settings service where clients can find all the necessary URLs and properties of the OpenId provider such as `jwks.endpoint`, `token.endpoint`, `logout.endpoint`, `realm.name`, `client_id` etc returned. in JSON format.

Service class is *org.eclipse.che.multiuser.keycloak.server.KeycloakSettings*, and it is bound only in multi-user version of Che, so by its presence it is possible to detect if authentication enabled in current deployment or not.

Example output:

[source,json]
----
{
    "che.keycloak.token.endpoint": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth/realms/che/protocol/openid-connect/token",
    "che.keycloak.profile.endpoint": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth/realms/che/account",
    "che.keycloak.client_id": "che-public",
    "che.keycloak.auth_server_url": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth",
    "che.keycloak.password.endpoint": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth/realms/che/account/password",
    "che.keycloak.logout.endpoint": "http://172.19.20.9:5050/auth/realms/che/protocol/openid-connect/logout",
    "che.keycloak.realm": "che"
}
----

Also, this service allows to download JS client library to interact with provider. Service URL is `<che.host>:<che.port>/api/keycloak/settings` for retrieving settings JSON and `<che.host>:<che.port>/api/keycloak/OIDCKeycloak.js` for JS adapter library.

Next step is redirection of user to the appropriate provider’s login page with all the necessary params like client_id, return redirection path etc. This can be basically done with any client library (JS or Java etc).

After user logged in on provider’s side and client side code obtained and passed the JWT token, validation of it and creation of subject begins.

Verification of tokens signature occurs in the two main filters chain:

* *org.eclipse.che.multiuser.keycloak.server.KeycloakAuthenticationFilter* class. Token is extracted from `Authorization` header or `token` query param and tried to being parsed using public key retrieved from provider. In case of expired/invalid/malformed token, 403 error is sent to user. As noted above, usage of query parameter should be minimised as much as possible, since support of it may be limited/dropped at some point.

If validation was successful, token is passed to the

* *org.eclipse.che.multiuser.keycloak.server.KeycloakEnvironmentInitalizationFilter* filter in the parsed form. This filter simply extracts data from JWT token claims, creates user in the local DB if it is not yet present, and constructs subject object and sets it into per-request `EnvironmentContext` object which is statically accessible everywhere.

If the request was made using machine token only (e.g. from ws agent) then it is only one auth filter in the chain:

* *org.eclipse.che.multiuser.machine.authentication.server.MachineLoginFilter* - finds userId given token belongs to, than retrieves user instance and sets principal to the session.

Master-to-master requests are performed using *org.eclipse.che.multiuser.keycloak.server.KeycloakHttpJsonRequestFactory* which signs every request with the current subject token obtained from EnvironmentContext.

[id="user-profile"]
==== User Profile

Since keycloak may store user specific information (first/last name, phone number, job title etc), there is special implementation of the ProfileDao which can provide this data to consumers inside Che. Implementation is read-only, so no create/update operations are possible. Class is *org.eclipse.che.multiuser.keycloak.server.dao.KeycloakProfileDao*.

[id="obtaining-token-from-keycloak"]
==== Obtaining Token From Keycloak

For the clients which cannot run JS or other type clients (like CLI or selenium tests), auth token may be requested directly from Keycloak. The simplest way to obtain Keycloak auth token, is to perform request to the token endpoint with username and password credentials. This request can be schematically described as following cURL request:

----
curl
    --data "grant_type=password&client_id=<client_name>&username=<username>&password=<password>"
     http://<keyckloak_host>:5050/auth/realms/<realm_name>/protocol/openid-connect/token
----

Since the two main Che clients (IDE and Dashboard) utilizes native Keycloak js library, they’re using a customized Keycloak login page and somewhat more complicated authentication mechanism using `grant_type=authorization_code`. It’s a two step authentication: first step is login and obtaining authorization code, and second step is obtaining token using this code.

Example of correct token response:

[source,json]
----
{
   "access_token":"eyJhb...<rest of JWT token here>",
   "expires_in":300,
   "refresh_expires_in":1800,
   "refresh_token":"Nj0C...<rest of refresh token here>",
   "token_type":"bearer",
   "not-before-policy":0,
   "session_state":"14de1b98-8065-43e1-9536-43e7472250c9"
}
----

[id="other-authentication-implementations"]
=== Other authentication implementations

If you want to adapt authentication implementation other than Keycloak, the following steps must be done:

* Write own or refactor existing info service which will provide list of configured provider endpoints to the clients;
* Write single or chain of filters to validate tokens, create user in Che DB and compose the Subject object;
* If the new auth provider supports OpenId protocol, OIDC JS client available at settings endpoint can be used as well since it is maximally decoupled of specific implementations.
* If the selected provider stores some additional data about user (first/last name, job title etc), it is a good idea to write an provider-specific ProfileDao implementation which will provide such kind of information.

[id="oauth"]
=== OAuth

OAuth authentication part has 2 main flows - internal and external based on Keycloak brokering mechanism. So, there are 2 main OAuth API implementations - *org.eclipse.che.security.oauth.EmbeddedOAuthAPI* and *org.eclipse.che.multiuser.keycloak.server.oauth2.DelegatedOAuthAPI*.

They can be switched using `che.oauth.service_mode=<embedded|delegated>` configuration property.

Also, there is support of OAuth1 protocol can be found at *org.eclipse.che.security.oauth1* package.

The main REST endpoint in tha OAuth API is *org.eclipse.che.security.oauth.OAuthAuthenticationService*, which contains `authenticate` method to start OAuth authentication flow, `callback` method to process callbacks from provider, `token` to retrieve current user’s oauth token, etc.

Those methods refer to the currently activated embedded/delegated OAuthAPI which is doing all the undercover stuff (finds appropriate authenticator, initializes the login process, user forwarding etc).

[id="authentication-on-che-agents"]
== Authentication on Che Agents

Machines may contain services that must be protected with authentication, e.g. agents like workspace agent and terminal. For this purpose, machine authentication mechanism should be used. Machine tokens were introduced to avoid passing the Keycloak tokens to the machine side (which can be potentially insecure). Another reason is that Keycloak tokens may have relatively small lifetime and require periodical renewal/refresh which is hard to manage and keep in sync with same user session tokens on clients etc.

As agents cannot be queried using Keycloak token, there is only Machine Token option. Machine token can be also passed in header or query parameter.

[id="machine-jwt-token"]
=== Machine JWT Token

Machine token is https://jwt.io/[JWT] that contains the following information in its claim:

* *uid* - id of user who owns this token
* *uname* - name of user who owns this token
* *wsid* - id of a workspace which can be queried with this token

Each user is provided with unique personal token for each workspace.

The structure of token and the signature are different to Keycloak and have the following view:

[source,json]
----
# Header
{
  "alg": "RS512",
  "kind": "machine_token"
}
# Payload
{
  "wsid": "workspacekrh99xjenek3h571",
  "uid": "b07e3a58-ed50-4a6e-be17-fcf49ff8b242",
  "uname": "john",
  "jti": "06c73349-2242-45f8-a94c-722e081bb6fd"
}
# Signature
{
  "value": "RSASHA512(base64UrlEncode(header) + . +  base64UrlEncode(payload))"
}
----

The algorithm that is used for signing machine tokens is `SHA-512` and it’s not configurable for now. Also, there is no public service that distributes the public part of the key pair with which the token was signed. But in each machine, there must be environment variables that contains key value. So, agents can verify machine JWT token using the following environment variables:

* `pass:[CHE_MACHINE_AUTH_SIGNATURE__ALGORITHM]` - contains information about the algorithm which the token was signed
* `pass:[CHE_MACHINE_AUTH_SIGNATURE__PUBLIC__KEY]` - contains public key value encoded in Base64

It’s all that is needed for verifying machine token inside of machine. To make sure that specified token is related to current workspace, it is needed to fetch `wsid` from JWT token claims and compare it with `CHE_WORKSPACE_ID` environment variable.

Also, if agents need to query Che Master they can use machine token provided in `CHE_MACHINE_TOKEN` environment, actually it is token of user who starts a workspace.

[id="authentication-schema"]
=== Authentication schema

The way how Che master interacts with agents with enabled authentication mechanism is the following:

image::diagrams/machine_auth_flow.png[]

Machine token verification on agents is done by the following components:

* *org.eclipse.che.multiuser.machine.authentication.agent.MachineLoginFilter* - doing basically the same as the appropriate filter on a master, the only thing that is different it’s a way how agent obtains the public signature part. The public key for the signature check is placed in a machine environment, with algorithm description.
* *auth.auth.go* - the entry point for all request that is proceeding on go agents side, the logic of token verification is similar with MachineLoginFilter.

[id="obtaining-machine-token"]
=== Obtaining Machine Token

A machine token is provided for users in runtime object. It can be fetched by using get workspace by key (id or namespace/name) method which path equals to `/api/workspace/<workspace_key>`. The machine token will be placed in `runtime.machineToken` field.

[id="using-swagger-or-rest-clients"]
== Using Swagger or REST Clients

User’s Keycloak token is used to execute queries to secured API on his behalf through REST clients. A valid token must be attached as request header or query parameter - `?token=$token`. Che Swagger can be accessed from `http://che_host:8080/swagger`. A user must be signed-in through Keycloak so that access token is included in request headers.

By default, swagger loads `swagger.json` from link:che-master.html[Master].

To work with WS Agent, a URL to its `swagger.json` should be provided. It can be retrieved from link:workspace-data-model.html#runtime[Workspace Runtime], by getting URL to link:servers[WS Agent server] endpoint and adding `api/docs/swagger.json` to it. Also, to authenticate on WS Agent API, user must include Machine Token, which can be found in Workspace Runtime as well.

To use Swagger for a workspace agent, user must do following steps:

* get workspace object with runtimes fetched (using `/api/workspace/<workspace_key>` service)
* get WS agent API endpoint URL, and add a path to its `swagger.json` (e.g. `http://<che_host>:<machine_port>/api/docs/swagger.json` for Docker or `http://<ws-agent-route>/api/docs/swagger.json` for OpenShift ). Put it in the upper bar `URL` field:

[source,json]

"wsagent/http": {
  "url": "http://172.19.20.180:32777/api",
