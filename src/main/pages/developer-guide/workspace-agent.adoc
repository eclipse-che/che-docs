== Enabling debugging on Workspace Agent

. Configure your WS Agent Tomcat JPDA launching parameters with the following Workspace environment variables:
+
`WSAGENT_DEBUG`:: Set to `true` to enable JPDA mode for Workspace Agent Tomcat. The default is `false`.
`WSAGENT_DEBUG_PORT`:: Configure the JPDA port. The default is `4403`.
`WSAGENT_DEBUG_SUSPEND`:: Set to `y` to enable JPDA suspend mode. The default is `n`.

. Get a host and a port for connecting to Workspace Agent Tomcat.

=== Connecting to Workspace Agent Tomcat with a debugger

You will need a host and port for the debugger. The process of acquiring it differs depending on the Che infrastructure:

==== Connecting a debugger on Docker

* Before starting a workspace, define a link:servers.html[Server] for your JPDA port.

* You will need to use a port on your host that is mapped to a port in the container. It can be found in *Workspace Servers* of a running workspace:

==== Connecting a debugger on Kubernetes or OpenShift

To connect with a debugger from outside of the cluster, use _port forwarding_ to forward a port from your workspace pod to the port on your localhost.

*For Kubernetes:*

Use the following command to find the name and namespace of your workspace pod:

----
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
----

----
$ kubectl port-forward <POD_NAME> <LOCAL_PORT>:<JPDA_PORT>--namespace=<NAMESPACE>
----

In the command above, replace:

* `<JPDA_PORT>` with the port of your configured JPDA Tomcat
* `<LOCAL_PORT>` with the port on your host that you will connect to with your debugger
* `<POD_NAME>` with the name of the workspace pod
* `<NAMESPACE>` with the namespace of the workspace pod

*For Openshift:*

Use the following commands to get name of your pod:

----
$ oc login
$ oc get pods
----

For a pod that belongs to a different namespace (if Che is configured to create an OpenShift project per workspace), use `oc use <WORKSPACE_ID>` to switch to that project and run `oc get pods` again.

----
$ oc port-forward <POD_NAME> <LOCAL_PORT>:<JPDA_PORT>
----

In the command above, replace:

* `<JPDA_PORT>` with the port of your configured JPDA Tomcat
* `<LOCAL_PORT>` with the port on your host that you will connect to with your debugger
* `<POD_NAME>` with the name of the workspace pod

Connect to your debugger using `localhost` as the host and your local port, which is forwarded to the workspace pod.
