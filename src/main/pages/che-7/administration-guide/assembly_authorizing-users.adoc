User authorization in Che is based on the permissions model. Permissions are used to control the allowed actions of users and establish a security model. Every request is verified for the presence of the required permission in the current user subject after it passes authentication. You can control resources managed by Che and allow certain actions by assigning permissions to users.

Permissions can be applied to the following entities:

* Workspace
* Organization
* System

All permissions can be managed using the provided REST API. The APIs are documented using Swagger at `[{host}/swagger/#!/permissions]`.
