= Using Swagger or REST clients to execute queries

.Procedure

The user's Keycloak token is used to execute queries to the secured API on the user's behalf through REST clients. A valid token must be attached as the *Request* header or the `?token=$token` query parameter.

Access the Che Swagger interface at `http://che_host:8080/swagger`. The user must be signed in through Keycloak, so that the access token is included in the *Request* header.
