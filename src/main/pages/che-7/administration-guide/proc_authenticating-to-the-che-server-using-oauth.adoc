= Authenticating to the {prod-short} server using OAuth

For easy user interaction with third-party services, the {prod-short} server supports OAuth authentication. OAuth tokens are also used for GitHub-related plug-ins.

OAuth authentication has two main flows: internal and external, which is based on the Keycloak brokering mechanism. The following are the two main OAuth API implementations:

* *org.eclipse.che.security.oauth.EmbeddedOAuthAPI*, for the internal flow.

* *org.eclipse.che.multiuser.keycloak.server.oauth2.DelegatedOAuthAPI*, for the external flow.

Use the `che.oauth.service_mode=__<embedded|delegated>__` configuration property to switch between the two implementations. The main REST endpoint in the OAuth API is *org.eclipse.che.security.oauth.OAuthAuthenticationService, which contains*:

* An authenticate method to start the OAuth authentication flow
* A callback method to process callbacks from the provider
* A token to retrieve the current user's OAuth token

These methods refer to the currently activated embedded or delegated OAuthAPI that does the underlying operations, including finding the appropriate authenticator, initializing the login process, and user forwarding.
