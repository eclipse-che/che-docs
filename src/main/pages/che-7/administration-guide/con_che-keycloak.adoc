[id="{prod-id-short}-keycloak_{context}"]
= {prod-short} and {identity-provider}

{identity-provider} is a prerequisite to configure {prod-short} in multi-user mode. The {prod-short} administrator can choose to connect {prod-short} to an existing {identity-provider} instance or let the {prod-short} deployment start a new dedicated {identity-provider} instance.

The {prod-short} server uses {identity-provider} as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider to authenticate {prod-short} users and secure access to {prod-short} resources.
