= Developing Grafana dashboards

Grafana offers the possibility to add custom panels.


.Procedure

To add a custom panel, use the *New dashboard* view.

. In the first section, define *Queries to*. Use the _Prometheus Query Language_ to construct a specific metric, as well as to modify it with various aggregation operators.
+
.New Grafana dashboard: Queries to

. In the *Visualisation* section, choose a metric to be shown in the following visual in the form of a graph, gauge, heatmap, or others.
+
.New Grafana dashboard: Visualization

. Save changes to the dashboard by clicking the btn:[Save] button, and copy and paste the JSON code to the deployment.

. Load changes in the configuration of a running Grafana deployment. First remove the deployment:
+
----
$ oc process -f che-monitoring.yaml | oc delete -f -
----
+
Then redeploy your Grafana with the new configuration:
+
----
$ oc process -f che-monitoring.yaml | oc apply -f - | oc rollout latest grafana
