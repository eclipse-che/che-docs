= {prod-short} Architectural Components

As illustrated in the link:{site-baseurl}che-7/high-level-che-architecture[High Level {prod-short} Architecture] article, {prod} components are:

* A central workspace controller: an always up service that manages users workspaces
* Users workspaces: container based IDEs that the controller stops when the user stops coding

Both the {prod-short} central controller and user workspaces consists of a set of containers. Those containers contribute to the resources consumption in terms of CPU and RAM limit and request. For a detailed explanation of how Kubernetes is managing containers compute resources requests and limits refer to the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/[Kubernetes Documentation].
