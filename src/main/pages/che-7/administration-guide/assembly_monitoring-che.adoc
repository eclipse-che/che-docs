Che can expose certain data as metrics, that can be processed by Prometheus and Grafana stacks. Prometheus is a monitoring system, that maintains the collection of metrics - time series key-value data which can represent consumption of resources like CPU and memory, amount of processed HTTP queries and their execution time, and Che specific resources, such as number of users and workspaces, the start and shutdown of workspaces, information about JsonRPC stack.

Prometheus is powered with a special query language, that allows manipulating the collected data, and performing various binary, vector, and aggregation operations with it. This helps create a more refined view on data.

Prometheus is the central piece, which is responsible for scraping and storing the metrics. Grafana offers a front-end "facade" with tools to create various visual representations in the form of dashboards with panels and graph types.

== Enabling Che metrics collections

[id='prerequisites-{context}',discrete]
.Prerequisites

* Installed Prometheus 2.9.1 or higher. For more information, see link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/].
* Installed Grafana 6.0 or higher. For more information, see link:https://grafana.com/docs/installation/[https://grafana.com/docs/installation/]

.Procedure

. Set the `CHE_METRICS_ENABLED=true` environment variable.

. Expose the `8087` port as a service on the che-master host.

. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the `8087` port.

. Configure a Prometheus data source on Grafana.

. Deploy Che-specific dashboards on Grafana.
