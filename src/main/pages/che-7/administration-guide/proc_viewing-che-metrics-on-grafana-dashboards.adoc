= Viewing {prod-short} metrics on Grafana dashboards

This section describes how to view {prod-short} metrics on Grafana dashboards.

.Prerequisites

* Prometheus is collecting metrics on the {prod-short} cluster. See xref:collecting-{prod-id-short}-metrics-with-prometheus_{context}[].

* Grafana 6.0 or above is running on port `3000` with a corresponding *service* and *route*. See link:https://grafana.com/docs/installation/[Installing Grafana].


.Procedure

. Deploy {prod-short}-specific dashboards on Grafana using the `che-monitoring.yaml` configuration file.
+
Three ConfigMaps are used to configure Grafana:
+
* `grafana-datasources` -- configuration for Grafana datasource, a Prometheus endpoint
* `grafana-dashboards` -- configuration of Grafana dashboards and panels
* `grafana-dashboard-provider`  -- configuration of the Grafana dashboard provider API object, which tells Grafana where to look in the file system for pre-provisioned dashboards





.Verification steps

* Use the Grafana console to view {prod-short} metrics.
