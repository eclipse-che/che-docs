= Collecting Che metrics with Prometheus

Prometheus is a monitoring system that collects metrics in real time and stores them in a time series database.

Prometheus comes with a console accessible at the `9090` port of the application pod. By default, a template provides an existing *service* and a *route* to access it. It can be used to query and view metrics.

== Prometheus terminology

Prometheus offers:

counter:: The simplest numerical type of metric whose value can be only increased. A typical example is counting the amount of HTTP requests that go through the system.

gauge:: Numerical value that can be increased or decreased. Best suited for representing values of objects.

histogram:: A more complex metric that is suited for performing observations. Metrics are collected and grouped in configurable buckets, which allows to present the results, for instance, in the form of a heatmap.

== Configuring Prometheus

.Prometheus configuration
[source,yaml]
----
- apiVersion: v1
  data:
    prometheus.yml: |-
      global:
        scrape_interval:     5s           <1>
        evaluation_interval: 5s           <2>
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'che'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['che-host:8087']
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
