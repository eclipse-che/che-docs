Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions work in a workspace. VS Code extensions can run in the Che-Theia editor container, or in their own isolated and pre-configured containers with their prerequisites.

This document describes  how to test a VS Code extension in {prod-short} with workspaces.

** The extension-hosting sidecar container and the use of the extension in a devfile are optional for this.
** How to review the compatibility of the VS Code extensions to check whether a specific API is there or not.
