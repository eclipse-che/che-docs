The che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property defines how the path of the ingress should be transformed to support the URL rewriting and this property defines the set of annotations on the ingress itself that instruct the chosen ingress controller to actually do the URL rewriting, potentially building on the path transformation (if required by the chosen ingress controller). For example for nginx ingress controller 0.22.0 and later the following value is recommended: `+{'ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target': '/$1','ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect': 'false',\     'ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout': '3600','ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout': '3600'}+` and the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform should be set to '%s(.*)' For nginx ingress controller older than 0.22.0, the rewrite-target should be set to merely '/' and the path transform to '%s' (see the the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.path.rewrite_transform property).

Please see the description of the che.infra.kubernetes.ingress.annotations_json property to see how these two properties interplay when specifying the ingress annotations and path.
