.Prerequisites

The `my-plug-in-registry` and `my-devfile-registry` images used in this section are built using the `docker` command. This section assumes that these images are available on the Kubernetes and OpenShift cluster where {prod-short} is deployed.

This is true on Minishift or Minikube, for example, if before running the `docker build` commands, the user executed the `eval $\{minikube docker-env}` command (or, the `eval $\{minishift docker-env}` command for Minishift).

Otherwise, these images can be pushed to a container registry (public, such as `quay.io`, or the DockerHub, or a private registry).
