:context: persistent-volumes-backups

Persistent Volumes (PVs) store the {prod-short} workspace data similarly to how workspace data is stored for desktop IDEs on the local hard disk drive.

To prevent data loss, back up PVs periodically. The recommended approach is to use storage-agnostic tools for backing up and restoring Kubernetes resources, including PVs.

== Recommended backup tool: Velero

Velero is an open-source tool for backing up Kubernetes applications and their PVs. Velero allows you to:

* Deploy in the cloud or on premises.
* Back up the cluster and restore in case of data loss.
* Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.
* Replicate a production cluster to development and testing clusters.

NOTE: Alternatively, you can use backup solutions dependent on the underlying storage system. For example, solutions that are Gluster or Ceph-specific.
