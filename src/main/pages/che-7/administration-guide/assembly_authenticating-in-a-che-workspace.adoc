Workspace containers may contain services that must be protected with authentication. Such protected services are called *secure*. For this purpose, a machine authentication mechanism should be used. Machine tokens avoid the need to pass {identity-provider} tokens to workspace containers (which can be insecure). Also, {identity-provider} tokens may have a relatively shorter lifetime and require periodic renewals or refreshes, which is difficult to manage and keep in sync with the same user session tokens on clients.
