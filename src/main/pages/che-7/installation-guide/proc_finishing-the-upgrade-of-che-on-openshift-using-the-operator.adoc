= Finishing the upgrade of {prod-short} on OpenShift using the Operator

This section describes how to finish the upgrade from {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} to {prod-short} {prod-ver} on OpenShift using the Operator.

.Prerequisites

* The {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} Operator is removed. See xref:preparing-the-upgrade-of-{prod-id-short}-on-openshift-using-the-operator_{context}[]

* The {prod-short} {prod-ver} Operator is deployed. See xref:installing-the-{prod-id-short}-operator-in-openshift-4-web-console_{context}[]

* The {prod-short} {prod-ver} Operator has finished upgrading the {prod} cluster. See xref:viewing-the-state-of-the-{prod-id-short}-cluster-deployment-in-openshift-4-web-console_{context}[]

.Procedure

. Log into the {prod} instance.

. Select an old workspace and click the btn:[Start] button.

. An error message appears, with a link to the documentation explaining how to migrate a workspace to a devfile.

. For each workspace, create a devfile that represent your workspace. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/converting-a-che-6-workspace-to-a-che-7-devfile[Converting a {prod-short} {prod-prev-ver} workspace to a {prod-short} {prod-ver} devfile].

. Use the devfile to start the new workspace. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/configuring-a-workspace-using-a-devfile[Configuring a workspace using a devfile]
