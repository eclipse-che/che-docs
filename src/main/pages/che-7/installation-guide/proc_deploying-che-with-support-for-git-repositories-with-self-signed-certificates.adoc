= Deploying {prod-short} with support for Git repositories with self-signed certificates

This procedure describes how to configure {prod-short} for deployment with support for Git operations on repositories that use self-signed certificates.

.Prerequisites

* Git version 2 or later.

.Procedure

[discrete]
== Configuring support for self-signed Git repositories on Kubernetes

.Deploying {prod-short} using a link:https://helm.sh/[Helm Chart]

. Configure the workspace exposure strategy using the `global.useGitSelfSignedCerts` property. To do that, add the following option to the `helm upgrade` command:
+
----
$ helm upgrade che --set global.useGitSelfSignedCerts=true
----

. Create a new *configMap* with details about the Git server:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ kubectl create configmap che-git-self-signed-cert --from-file=__<ca.crt>__ \
  --from-literal=githost=__<host:port>__ -n=che
----
+
In the command, substitute `_<ca.crt>_` for the self-signed certificate and _`<host:port>_` for the host and port of the HTTPS connection on the Git server (optional).
+
NOTE: When `githost` is not specified, the given certificate is used for all HTTPS repositories.

// == Configuring support for self-signed Git repositories on OpenShift

Create and start new workspace. Every container used by the workspace mounts a special volume that contains a file with the self-signed certificate. The repository's `.git/config` file contains information about the Git server host (its URL) and the path to the certificate in the `http` section (see Git documentation about link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-httpsslCAInfo[git-config]). For example:

----
[http "https://10.33.177.118:3000"]
        sslCAInfo = /etc/che/git/cert/ca.crt
----
