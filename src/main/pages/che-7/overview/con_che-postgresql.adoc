[id="{prod-id-short}-postgresql_{context}"]
= {prod-short} and PostgreSQL

The PostgreSQL database is a prerequisite to configure {prod-short} in multi-user mode. The {prod-short} administrator can choose to connect {prod-short} to an existing PostgreSQL instance or let the {prod-short} deployment start a new dedicated PostgreSQL instance.

The {prod-short} server uses the database to persist user configurations (workspaces metadata, Git credentials). {identity-provider} uses the database as its back end to persist user information.
