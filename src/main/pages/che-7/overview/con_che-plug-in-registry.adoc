= Che plug-in registry

The Che plug-in registry is a service that provides the list of plug-ins and editors for the Che workspaces. A devfile can reference only a plug-in that is published in a Che plug-in registry. It runs in a container and can be deployed wherever wsmaster connects. The default registry: link:https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io/[che-plugin-registry.openshift.io].
