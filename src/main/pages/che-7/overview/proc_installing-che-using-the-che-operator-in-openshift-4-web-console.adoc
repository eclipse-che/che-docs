= Installing {prod-short} using the {prod-short} Operator in OpenShift 4 web console

This section describes how to install {prod-short} using the {prod-short} Operator in OpenShift 4 web console.


Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application which also provide the following:

* Repeatability of installation and upgrade.

* Constant health checks of every system component.

* Over-the-air (OTA) updates for OpenShift components and independent software vendor (ISV) content.

* A place to encapsulate knowledge from field engineers and spread it to all users.

On OpenShift, {prod} can be installed using the OperatorHub Catalog present in the OpenShift web console.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to use the `{prod-cli}` utility script for deploying {prod-short} on {ocp} and {osd} versions {oc4-ver}. This method is considered unofficial and serves as a backup installation method for situations where the installation method using OperatorHub is not available.

For information about how to use the `{prod-cli}` utility script for deploying {prod-short} on OpenShift, see the
{link-installing-on-openShift-3-using-the-operator} section.

.Prerequisites

* An administrator account on a running instance of OpenShift 4.
* At least one OAuth user provisioned on this instance of OpenShift 4.
* The {prod-short} Operator is installed on this instance of OpenShift 4. See xref:installing-the-{prod-id-short}-operator-in-openshift-4-web-console_{context}[].

.Procedure

. Open the OpenShift web console.

. To create the `{prod}` project, in the left panel, navigate to the *Home* -> *Projects* section.

. Click the btn:[Create Project] button.

. In the *Create Project* pop-up window, enter the project details and validate.
+
* *Name*: `{prod-short}`.
* *Display Name*: `{prod}`.
* *Description*: `{prod}`.

. To install the *{prod}* Operator, in the left panel, navigate to the *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* section.

. In the *Filter by keyword* field, type `{prod}`.

. Click the *{prod}* tile.

. In the *{prod}* pop-up window, click the btn:[Install] button .

. In the *Install Operator* screen, choose following options and validate:
+
* *Installation mode*: *A specific namespace on the cluster*.

. In the *Installed operators* screen, click the *{prod}* name.

. In the *Operator Details* screen, in the *Details* tab, inside of the *Provided APIs* section, click the *Create Instance* link.

. The *Create CheCluster* page contains the configuration of the overall {prod-short} instance to create. It is defined as the `CheCluster` Custom Resource. For an installation using the default configuration, keep the default values.
To modify the configuration, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/configuring-the-che-installation[Configuring the {prod-short} installation]. It is necessary to modify the configuration to use self-signed certificates. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/installing-che-in-tls-mode-with-self-signed-certificates/[Installing [prod-short} in TLS mode with self-signed certificates].

. To create the *{prod-checluster}* cluster, click the btn:[Create] button in the lower left corner of the window.

. In the *Operator Details* screen, in the *{prod} Cluster* tab, click on the *{prod-checluster}* link.

. To navigate to the *{prod-checluster}* instance, click the link under *{prod} URL*.

.Validation steps

. To validate the installation of the *{prod}* Operator, in the left panel, navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* section.

. In the *Installed operators* screen, click on the *{prod}* name.

. Navigate to the *Details* tab.

. In the *CLusterServiceVersion Details* section at the bottom of the page, wait for these messages:
+
* *Status*: `Succeeded`.
* *Status Reason*: `install strategy completed with no errors`.

. Navigate to the *Events* tab.

. Wait for this message: `install strategy completed with no errors`.

. To validate the installation of the *{prod}* instance, navigate to the *{prod2} Cluster* tab.

. The *CheClusters* screen displays the list of *{prod}* instances and their status.

. Click *{prod-checluster}* `CheCluster` in the table.

+
* *Message*: the field contain error messages, if any. The expected content is `None`.
* *Eclipse Che URL*: displays the presence of the URL of the *{prod}* instance, once the deployment is successful. An empty field means the deployment didn't succeed.

. Navigate to the *Resources* tab.

. The screen displays the list of the resources assigned to the {prod-short} deployment.

. To see more details on the state of a resource, click on its name and inspect the content of the available tabs.
