= Che user runtimes

Any non-terminating user container can be used as a user runtime. An application that can be defined as a container image or as a set of Kubernetes or OpenShift resources can be included in a Che workspace. This makes it easy to test applications in the Che workspace.

To test an application in the Che workspace, include the application YAML definition used in stage or production in the workspace specification. It is a 12-factor app dev/prod parity.

Examples of user runtimes are NodeJS, SpringBoot or MongoDB, and MySQL.
