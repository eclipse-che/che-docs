= {prod-short} workspaces architecture

:context: {prod-id-short}-workspaces-architecture

A {prod-short} deployment on the cluster consists of the {prod-short} server component, a database for storing user profile and preferences, and a number of additional deployments hosting workspaces. The {prod-short} server orchestrates the creation of workspaces, which consist of a deployment containing the workspace containers and enabled plug-ins, plus related components, such as:

* ConfigMaps
* services
* endpoints
* ingresses/routes
* secrets
* PVs

The {prod-short} workspace is a web application. It is composed of microservices running in containers that provide all the services of a modern IDE (an editor, language auto-completion, debugging tools). The IDE services are deployed with the development tools, packaged in containers and user runtime applications, which are defined as Kubernetes resources.

The source code of the projects of a {prod-short} workspace is persisted in a Kubernetes `PersistentVolume`. Microservices run in containers that have read-write access to the source code (IDE services, development tools), and runtime applications have read-write access to this shared directory.

The following diagram shows the detailed components of a {prod-short} workspace.

In the diagram, there are three running workspaces: two belonging to *User A* and one to *User C*. A fourth workspace is getting provisioned where the plug-in broker is verifying and completing the workspace configuration.

Use the devfile format to specify the tools and runtime applications of a {prod-short} workspace.
