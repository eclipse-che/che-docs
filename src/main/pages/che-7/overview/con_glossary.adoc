:context: che-glossary

This section provides an overview of the main terms and expressions used throughout {prod} documentation.

== Naming
{prod}:: A developer platform for the cloud that provides an in-browser IDE. {prod-short} tools can be extended by adding development services, such as language servers, debug adapters, or editors (IDEs) packaged as containers. 

Che-Theia:: The default editor component of a {prod-short} workspace. It is a {prod-short}-specific customization of the Eclipse Theia editor. Che-Theia can be extended using Che-Theia plugins, which are packaged as containers for ease of deployment and use. Che-Theia plugins are mostly compatible with Visual Studio extensions.

{prod-short} Workspace:: A container-based development environment managed by {prod}. Every {prod-short} workspace is defined by a devfile. A {prod-short} workspace is composed of an editor, runtime and build containers and other development tools running inside containers.

== Terminology
Organization:: Organizations in {prod} allow administrators to group {prod} users and allocate resources. The system administrator controls and allocates resources and permissions within the administrator dashboard.

Editor:: A web application that is used as an editor in a workspace.

Plugin:: Plugins are services that extend {prod-short} workspace capabilities. {prod-short} plugins are packaged as containers. Plugins are extensions of an editor or a service running in the container. For example, the Che-Theia editor is compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. 
//TODO See for a diagram of Che extensibility architecture. 
Both {prod-short} plugins and editors are distributed through the {prod-short} plugin registry. 
 
Workspace:: A container based development environment managed by Eclipse Che. Every  {prod-short} workspace is defined by a devfile. A  {prod-short} workspace can be composed by an editor, some plugins and runtime containers. Workspace runtime containers can be defined as simple container images or as Kubernetes and OpenShift resources. A {prod-short} Workspace can be associated with source code projects hosted on a remote CVS server. A {prod-short} Workspace can contain the definition of one or more commands such as `run`, `build`, or `debug`.

Devfile:: A workspace configuration template. Devfiles are used to create workspaces in the Dashboard. A devfile includes metadata such as scope, tags, components, description, name, and identification. VS Code API is one of the plugin APIs that can be used in Theia.

Factory:: A template that contains the configuration to automate the generation of a new workspace using a factory identifier or a devfile added to the URL of the IDE. Use factories to create replicas of existing workspaces or to automate the provisioning of statically or dynamically defined workspaces.

Project:: A source code repository.
