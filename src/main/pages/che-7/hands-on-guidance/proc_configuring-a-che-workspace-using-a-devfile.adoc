= Configuring a Che workspace using a Devfile

This section will show how to select a workspace, loading in the required stack and a sample project, all in one step.

Please refer to the link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile[Devfile specifications] for detailed information how to add or remove components, or how to set memory and environment variables.

== Prerequisites

* You need an OKD, OCP, or OSD cluster, if using Che on Openshift. See below for use of link:https://www.okd.io/minishift/[Minishift] (OKD).

* Or, you can use a Kubernetes cluster such as link:https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation[Minikube].

* To install on Minishift or Minikube, see xref:che-quick-starts#deploying-che-using-chectl[Deploying Che using chectl].

== Procedure

=== Importing a project using a devfile

Stacks are defined as link:using-developer-environments-workspaces.html#making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile_using-developer-environments-workspaces[devfiles]. This gives the user more flexibility when defining the project(s), IDE, commands, tools, and application runtimes needed in their workspace.

[NOTE]
In Che 6, a stack is defined with a `Dockerfile`. In Che 7, `devfile.yaml` is used instead.

==== The minimal devfile

The following is the minimum content required in a `devfile.yaml` file:

* link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile#apiversion[apiVersion]
* link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile#metadata[metadata name]
* link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile#projects[projects name and source]

```
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: che-in-che-out
projects:
  - name: che
    source:
      type: git
      location: 'https://github.com/eclipse/che.git'
```

For a complete `devfile` example file, see link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/devfile.yaml[Eclipse Che in Che devfile.yaml].


==== Creating a workspace from a devfile

To create a workspace from a devfile:

. Commit a `devfile.yaml` file into the root of your git repo.

. When your repository contains a `devfile.yaml` file, point a running Che 7 instance at that link:https://github.com/eclipse/che[project] and it will use the discovered link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/devfile.yaml[devfile.yaml] file to build a workspace using the xref:api-reference#factory-api_api-reference[Factory API], `/f?url=`.

* For example, if you're using xref:che-quick-starts#deploying-che-using-chectl[Che inside Minishift]:

* http://che-che.`your.IP.address.here`.nip.io/f?url=link:https://github.com/eclipse/che[https://github.com/eclipse/che]

image:workspaces/che-in-che-devfile.png[Che in Che]

. You can also point at a plain text file:

* http://che-che.`your.IP.address.here`.nip.io/f?url=link:https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nickboldt/9551284c2c779a93ccf16bc801416205/raw/7ad1e949880d7f8ed30360e74bb9f8426450db05/devfile.yaml[https://path.to/my/devfile.yaml]

. If you are familiar with link:https://github.com/che-incubator/chectl/[chectl], you can also reference a local devfile.

* For example, if you're using xref:che-quick-starts#deploying-che-using-chectl[Che inside Minishift]:
+
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/che/master/devfile.yaml -o /tmp/devfile.yaml
./chectl workspace:start --devfile=/tmp/devfile.yaml --chenamespace=mini-che
```
+
```
$➔ ./chectl workspace:start --devfile=/tmp/devfile.yaml -n mini-che
  ✔ Retrieving Che Server URL...http://che-che.`your.IP.address.here`.nip.io
  ✔ Verify if Che server is running
  ✔ Create workspace from Devfile /tmp/devfile.yaml

Workspace IDE URL:
http://che-che.`your.IP.address.here`.nip.io/dashboard/#/ide/che/che-in-che

```
