== Generating an SSH key using the {prod-short} command palette

The following section describes a generation of an SSH key using the {prod-short} command palette and its further use in Git provider communication. This SSH key restricts permissions for the specific Git provider; thus, the user has to create a unique SSH key for each Git provider in use.

.Prerequisites
* A running instance of {prod-short}. To install an instance of {prod}, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[{prod-short} 'quick-starts'].

* An existing workspace defined on this instance of {prod-short} link:{site-baseurl}che-7/creating-and-configuring-a-new-che-7-workspace/[Creating a workspace from user dashboard].

.Prerequisites
* Personal link:https://help.github.com/en/articles/types-of-github-accounts[GitHub account] or other Git provider account created.

== Generating an SSH key

** In the {prod-short} IDE, press kbd:[F1] to open the Command Palette, or navigate to *View -> Find Command* in the top menu.
+
The *command palette* can be also activated by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+p] (or kbd:[Cmd+Shift+p] on macOS).

To generate an SSH key pair that only works with a particular Git provider:

. Run the *SSH: generate key pair for particular host* command. Do this by pressing kbd:[F1] to open the command dialogue box, then begin typing `generate`. You will be given options for SSH key generation.
. After the key is generated, click the btn:[View] button and copy the public key from the editor.
. Add the public key to the Git provider.


== Adding the associated public key to a repository or account on GitHub

To add the associated public key to a repository or account on GitHub:

. Navigate to link:https://github.com[github.com].
. Click the drop-down arrow next to the user icon in the top-right corner of the window.
. Click *Settings* -> *SSH and GPG keys* and then click the btn:[New SSH key] button.
. In the *Title* field, type a title for the key, and in the *Key* field, paste the public key copied from {prod-short}.
. Click the btn:[Add SSH key] button.

== Adding the associated public key to a Git repository or account on GitLab

To add the associated public key to a Git repository or account on GitLab:

. Navigate to link:https://gitlab.com[gitlab.com].
. Click the user icon in the top-right corner of the window.
. Click *Settings* -> *SSH Keys*.
