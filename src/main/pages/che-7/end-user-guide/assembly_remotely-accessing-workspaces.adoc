This section describes how to remotely access Che workspaces outside of the browser.

Che workspaces exist as containers and are, by default, modified from a browser window. In addition to this, there are the following methods of interacting with a Che workspace:

* Opening a command line in the workspace container using the Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`
* Uploading and downloading files using the `kubectl` tool
