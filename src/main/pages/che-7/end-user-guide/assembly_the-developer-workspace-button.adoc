It is common for code repositories to display badges in their `README` files that describe various aspects of the project, such as its test coverage, latest build status, link to documentation, and other things. For example, the {prod-short} GitHub `README` has the following badges:

image::workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png[link="{imagesdir}/workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png"]

To make the process of using {prod-short} easier, the following badge is available:

You can include this badge and link it to a {prod-short} instance to quickly open a developer workspace.


== Including the Developer Workspace Button in a `README`

=== Procedure

Add a link to your repository in the project `README`.  Using link:https://che.openshift.io[che.openshift.io] as an example {prod-short} host, and a GitHub repository:

[source,shell]

----

The snippet above will create a button that will open a Developer Workspace of the repository at link:https://github.com/org/repository[https://github.com/org/repository] at link:https://che.openshift.io/[che.openshift.io].  You can change the link to open a workspace in your {prod-short} installation by substituting your URL and repository:
