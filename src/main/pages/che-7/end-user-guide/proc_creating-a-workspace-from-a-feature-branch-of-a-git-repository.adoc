= Creating a workspace from a feature branch of a Git repository

A {prod-short} workspace can be created by pointing to devfile that is stored in a Git source repository on a feature branch of the user’s choice. The {prod-short} instance then uses the discovered devfile to build a workspace.

.Prerequisites
* A running instance of {prod}. To install an instance of {prod}, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[{prod-short} quick-starts].
* The `devfile.yaml` file in the root folder of a Git repository on a specific branch of the user's choice available over HTTPS. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile/[Making a workspace portable using a devfile] for detailed information about creating and using devfiles.

.Procedure
Execute the workspace by opening the following URL: `{prod-url}/f?url=__<GitHubBranch>__`

.Example
Use following URL format to open an experimental link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts[quarkus-quickstarts] branch hosted on link:https://che.openshift.io[che.openshift.io].
