* The `exec` type implies that the Che runner is used for command execution. The user can specify the component in whose container the command is executed.
* The `command` field contains the command line for execution.
* The `workdir` is the working directory in which the command is executed.

*Visual Studio Code (VS Code) tasks*

`run`

Here:

* The type is `vscode-task`.
* For this type of command, the `referenceContent` field must contain content with task configurations in the VS Code format.
* For more information about VS Code tasks, see the link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks[Task section at Visual Studio User Guide page].

*VS Code launch configurations*

`debug`
