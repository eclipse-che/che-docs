= Workspaces overview

Eclipse Che provides developer workspaces with everything needed to a code, build, test, run, and debug applications. To allow that, the developer workspaces provide four main components:

Project source code:: the source code of a project
Browser-based IDE:: a web-based IDE that is packaged by default in a workspace
Tool dependencies:: dependencies needed by developers to work on a project
Application runtime:: a replica of the environment where the application runs in production

Eclipse Che workspaces are managed by Kubernetes pods. Everything running in a Che developer workspace is running inside containers and is accessible from the embedded browser-based IDE. Because developer workspaces are containerized, they are highly portable. And because they only need a browser to be accessed, they are easily shareable.


== Features and benefits

[options="header",cols="h,,"]
|===
| Features
| Traditional IDE workspaces
| Eclipse Che workspaces

| Configuration and installation required
| Yes.
| No.

| Embedded tools
| Partial. IDE plug-ins need configuration. Dependencies need installation and configuration. Example: JDK, Maven, Node, ...
| Yes. Plug-ins provide their dependencies.

| Application runtime provided
| No. Developers have to manage that separately.
| Yes. Application runtime is replicated in the workspace.

| Shareable
| No.Or not easily                                                                                                 | Yes. Developer workspaces are shareable with a URL.

| Versionable
| No
| Yes. Devfiles live with project source code.

| Accessible from anywhere
| No. Installation is needed
| Yes. Only requires a browser.
