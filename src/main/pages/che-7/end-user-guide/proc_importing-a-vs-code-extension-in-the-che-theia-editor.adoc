= Importing a VS Code extension in the Che-Theia editor

This section describes how to install a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension from the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode[VS Code marketplace] in a {prod-short} workspace when using Che-Theia as the {prod-short} editor component.

This method of installing VS Code extensions is for extensions that do not have runtime dependencies. To install extensions that require particular dependencies (tools, environment variables, runtime servers), see section xref:publishing-a-vs-code-extension-into-the-{prod-id-short}-plug-in-registry_using-a-visual-studio-code-extension-in-{prod-id-short}[].

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod}. To install an instance of {prod}, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[{prod-short} 'quick-starts'].

* Configure the Che-Theia memory limit with 512 MB RAM or more to run the Che-Theia editor. In addition, reserve sufficient memory for the VS code extensions. The specific amount of memory required depends on the extensions used.

.Procedure

To import a VS Code extension in the Che-Theia editor:

. Navigate to the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode[VS Code marketplace], locate the required extension, and copy the *VS Code Quick Open* code to the clipboard.

. Open the *{prod-short} Plugins* panel in the Che-Theia IDE. If the panel is not shown, use the *View* -> *{prod-short} Plugins* menu options from the main menu.
+
For macOS users, paste the install command or the install button into the *{prod-short} Plugins* panel.
