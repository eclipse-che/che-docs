|Ingress 
|Kubernetes 
|Yes 
|No 
|Minishift allows you to create Ingress and it works when the host is specified (OpenShift creates a route for it). But, the `loadBalancer` IP is not provisioned. To add Ingress support for the OpenShift infrastructure node, generate routes based on the provided Ingress. 

|Route 
|OpenShift 
|No 
|Yes 
|The OpenShift recipe must be made compatible with the Kubernetes Infrastructure and, instead of the provided route, generate Ingress.

|Template 
|OpenShift 
|Yes 
|Yes 
|The Kubernetes API does not support templates. A workspace with a template in the recipe starts successfully and the default parameters are resolved.
