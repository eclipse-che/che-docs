:context: adding-tools-to-{prod-id-short}-after-creating-a-workspace

When installed in the workspace, {prod-short} plug-ins bring new capabilities to the {prod-short}. Plug-ins consist of a Che-Theia plug-in, metadata, and a hosting container. These plug-ins may provide the following capabilities:

* Integrating with other systems, including OpenShift and Kubernetes.
* Automating some developer tasks, such as formatting, refactoring, and running automated tests.
* Communicating with multiple databases directly from the IDE.
* Enhanced code navigation, auto-completion and error highlighting.

This chapter provides basic information about {prod-short} plug-in installation, enabling, and use in {prod-short} workspaces.
