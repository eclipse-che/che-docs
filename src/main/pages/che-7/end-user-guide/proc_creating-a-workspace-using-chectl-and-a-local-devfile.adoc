= Creating a workspace using chectl and a local devfile

A {prod-short} workspace can be created by pointing the `chectl` tool to a locally stored devfile. The {prod-short} instance then uses the discovered devfile to build a workspace.

.Prerequisites
* A running instance of {prod}. To install an instance of {prod}, see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/che-quick-starts/[{prod-short} quick-starts].
*  The link:https://github.com/che-incubator/chectl[`chectl`] command-line tool for managing a {prod-short} server and its development workspaces. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7/installing-the-chectl-management-tool/[Installing the `chectl` management tool].
* The devfile is available on the local filesystem in the current working directory. See link:{site-baseurl}che-7//making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile/[Making a workspace portable using a Devfile] for detailed information about creating and using devfiles.

.Example
Download the `devfile.yaml` file from the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/devfile.yaml[GitHub repository]  to the current working directory.

.Procedure
. Run a workspace from a devfile using the `workspace:start` parameter with the `chectl` tool as follows:
