= Che-Theia plug-in concept in detail

Eclipse Che provides a default web IDE for workspaces: Che-Theia. It is based on Eclipse Theia. It is a slightly different version than a plain Eclipse Theia as there are functionalities that have been added based on the nature of the Eclipse Che workspaces. We call this version of Eclipse Theia for Che: *Che-Theia*.

You can extend the IDE provided with Eclipse Che by building a *Che-Theia plug-in*. Che-Theia plug-ins are compatible with any other Eclipse Theia-based IDE.

== Client-side and server-side Che-Theia plug-ins

The Che-Theia editor plug-ins let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. Plug-ins run when the editor completes loading. If a Che-Theia plug-in fails, the main Che-Theia editor continues to work.

Che-Theia plug-ins run either on the client side or on the server side. This is a scheme of the client and server-side plug-in concept:

The same Che-Theia plug-in API is exposed to plugins running on the client side (Web Worker) or the server side (Node.js).


[id="che-theia-plug-in-apis_{context}"]
== Che-Theia plug-in APIs

For the purpose of providing tool isolation and easy extensibility in Eclipse Che, the Che-Theia IDE has a set of plug-in APIs. The APIs are compatible with Visual Studio Code extension APIs. In most cases, Che-Theia can run VS Code extensions as its own plug-ins.
// TODO: VS Code extensions as Che-Theia plug-ins. Read more at link:[LINK].

If the plug-in you are authoring depends on or interacts with components of Che workspaces (containers, preferences, factories, …), you can rely on the Che APIs that are embedded in Che-Theia.

== Che-Theia plug-in capabilities

Che-Theia plug-ins have the following capabilities:

[options="header",cols="3"]
|===
| *Plug-in*
| *Description*
| *Repository*

| *Che Extended Tasks*
| Handles the Che commands and provides the ability to start those into a specific container of the workspace.
|

| *Che Extended Terminal*
| Allows to provide terminal for any of the containers of the workspace.
|

| *Che Factory*
| Handles the Eclipse Che Factories
|

| *Che Container*
| Provides a container view that shows all the containers that are running in the workspace and allows to interact with them.

| *Dashboard*
| Integrates the IDE with the *Dashboard* and facilitate the navigation.
|

| *Che APIs*
| Extends the IDE APIs to allow interacting with Che-specific components (workspaces, preferences, etc.).

[id="vs-code-extensions-and-eclipse-theia-plug-ins_{context}"]
== VS Code extensions and Eclipse Theia plug-ins

A Che-Theia plug-in can be based on a VS Code extension or an Eclipse Theia plug-in.

A Visual Studio Code extension:: If you have already built your plug-in as a Visual Studio Code extension, you can build the corresponding Che-Theia plug-in by repackaging the extension. If the extension is relying on its own set of dependencies, it needs to package those into a container. Eclipse Che users get the plug-in and do not have to worry about the tool dependencies. See xref:converting-a-visual-studio-code-extension-to-a-che-theia-plug-in_developing-che-theia-plug-ins[].

An Eclipse Theia plug-in:: You can build a Che-Theia plug-in by implementing an Eclipse Theia plug-in and packaging it to Eclipse Che.
