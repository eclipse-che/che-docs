= Embedded and remote Che-Theia plug-ins

Developer workspaces in {prod} provide all dependencies needed to work on a project. The application includes the dependencies needed by all the tools and plug-ins used.

Che-Theia plug-in can run in two different ways, based on the necessary dependencies: *embedded* (or local) and *remote*.


[id="embedded-or-local-plug-ins_{context}"]
== Embedded (or local) plug-ins

The plug-in does not have specific dependencies - it only uses a Node.js runtime, and it runs in the same container as the IDE. The plug-in is injected into the IDE.

Examples:

* Code linting
* New set of commands
* New UI components

To include a Che-Theia plug-in as embedded, define a URL to the plug-in binary file (the `.theia` archive) in the `meta.yaml` file. In the case of a VS Code extension, provide the extension ID from the Visual Studio Code  marketplace (see link:{site-baseurl}che-7/using-a-visual-studio-code-extension-in-che[Using a Visual Studio Code extension in {prod-short}]).

When starting a workspace, {prod-short} downloads and unpacks the plug-in binaries and includes them in the Che-Theia editor container. The Che-Theia editor initializes the plug-ins when it starts.

[id="remote-plug-ins_{context}"]
== Remote plug-ins

The plug-in relies on dependencies or it has a back end. It runs in its own sidecar container, and all dependencies are packaged in the container.

A remote Che-Theia plug-in consist of two parts:

* Che-Theia plug-in or VS Code extension binaries. The definition in the `meta.yaml` file is the same as for embedded plug-ins.

* Container image definition, for example, `eclipse/che-theia-dev:nightly`. From this image, {prod-short} creates a separate container inside a workspace.

Examples:

* Java Language Server
* Python Language Server

When starting a workspace, {prod-short} creates a container from the plug-in image, downloads and unpacks the plug-in binaries, and includes them in the created container. The Che-Theia editor connects to the remote plug-ins when it starts.

== Comparison matrix

When a Che-Theia plug-in (or a VS Code extension) does not need extra dependencies inside its container, it is an embedded plug-in. A container with extra dependencies that includes a plug-in is a remote plug-in.

[options="header",cols="h,,,"]
|===
|  
| Configure RAM per plug-in
| Environment dependencies
| Create separated container

| Remote
| TRUE
| Plug-in uses dependencies defined in the remote container.
| TRUE

| Embedded
| FALSE (users can configure RAM for the whole editor container, but not per plug-in)
| Plug-in uses dependencies from the editor container; if container does not include these dependencies, the plug-in fails or does not function as expected.
| FALSE
|===

Depending on your use case and the capabilities provided by your plug-in, select one of the described running modes.
