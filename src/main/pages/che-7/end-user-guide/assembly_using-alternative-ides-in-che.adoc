= Using alternative IDEs in {prod-short}

:context: using-alternative-ides-in-che

Extending {prod} developer workspaces using different IDEs (integrated development environments) enables:

* Re-purposing the environment for different use cases.

* Providing a dedicated custom IDE for specific tools.

* Providing different perspectives for individual users or groups of users.

// In the traditional Eclipse IDE world, that was done with RCP applications.
// find out what's RCP?

{prod} provides a default web IDE to be used with the developer workspaces. This IDE is completely decoupled. You can bring your own custom IDE for {prod}:

* *Built from Eclipse Theia*, which is a framework to build web IDEs. Example: link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6aCqywKpyY[Sirius on the web].
// TODO: Learn more link:[LINK].

* *Completely different web IDEs*, such as Jupyter, Eclipse Dirigible, or others. Example: link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VooNzKxRFgw[Jupyter in {prod} workspaces].

.Bringing custom IDE built from Eclipse Theia

* Creating your own custom IDE based on Eclipse Theia.
* Adding {prod-short}-specific tools to your custom IDE.
* Packaging your custom IDE into the available editors for {prod-short}.
// TODO: all bullets needs links to docs

.Bringing your completely different web IDE into {prod-short}

* Packaging your custom IDE into the available editors for {prod-short}.
// TODO: bullet needs a link to docs
