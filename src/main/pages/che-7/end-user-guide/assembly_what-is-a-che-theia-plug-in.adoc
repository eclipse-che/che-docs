:context: what-is-a-che-theia-plug-in

A Che-Theia plug-in is an extension of the development environment isolated from the IDE. Plug-ins can be packaged as files or containers to provide their own dependencies.

Extending Che-Theia using plug-ins can enable the following capabilities:

* *Language support:* Extend the supported languages by relying on the https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/[Language Server Protocol].
* *Debuggers:* Extend debugging capabilities with the https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/[Debug Adapter Protocol].
* *Development Tools:* Integrate your favorite linters, as well as testing and performance tools.
* *Menus, panels, and commands:* Add your own items to the IDE components.
* *Themes:* Build custom themes, extend the UI, or customize icon themes.
* *Snippets, formatters, and syntax highlighting:* Enhance comfort of use with supported programming languages.
* *Keybindings:* Add new keymaps and popular keybindings to make the environment feel natural.

[options="header"]
|===
| *Features*            | *Description* | *Benefits*
| *Fast Loading*        | Plug-ins are loaded at runtime and are already compiled. IDE is loading the plug-in code. | Avoid any compilation time.Avoid post-install steps.
| *Secure Loading*      | Plug-ins are loaded separately from the IDE. The IDE stays always in an usable state. | Plug-in do not break the whole IDE if it has bugs. Handle network issue.
| *Tooling Dependencies*| Dependencies for the plug-in are packaged with the plug-in in its own container. | No-installation for tools.Dependencies running into container.
| *Code isolation*      | Guarantee that plug-ins cannot block the main functions of the IDE like opening a file or typing | Plug-ins are running into separate threads.Avoid dependencies mismatch.
| *VS Code Extension Compatibility* | Extend the capabilities of the IDE with existing VS Code Extensions. | Target multiple platform. Allow easy discovery of Visual Studio Code Extension with required installation.
