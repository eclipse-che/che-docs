 . You will be redirected to GitHub to authorize {prod-short}.
 . When {prod-short} is authorized, refresh the browser page where {prod-short} is running to update the plug-in with the GitHub token.

Alternatively, manually link:https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[fetch the GitHub token] and paste it to the plug-in by running the *GitHub Pull Requests: Manually Provide Authentication Response* command.
