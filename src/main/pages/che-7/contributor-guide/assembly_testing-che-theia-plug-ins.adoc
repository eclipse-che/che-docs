Developers can test how plug-ins work while working on themby running Che-Theia in hosted mode. It is a special mode in which Che-Theia loads your plug-in directly from the `/projects` directory (as opposed to the rest of the plug-ins, which are loaded from the plug-in registry). Che-Theia hosted mode is similar to debug mode in VS Code.


== Starting a hosted Che-Theia instance

. Press F1 to display the command palette, and run the `Hosted Plugin: Start Instance` command.

. Specify the path to the plug-in. A new browser tab will be opened.


.Status in the hosted instance

When running in hosted mode, Che-Theia displays a *Development Host* message in the status bar. When you hover over the message, a tip is displayed with the name of the hosted plug-in.

.Status in the main instance
At the same time, the main instance of Che-Theia displays a *Hosted Plugin* message in the status bar. This element indicates the state of the hosted instance. After starting the hosted instance, main Che-Theia begins to watch the code changes.

When you change something in your plug-in, you can just switch to the hosted Che-Theia instance, refresh the page, and immediately see the results.

.Plug-in output

When you run a hosted instance, the main Che-Theia instance opens the *Output* view. This view contains all output from the `yarn` backend process. It also contains the output of the backend plug-in that is being developed.

== Controlling a hosted Che-Theia instance

You can control the state of the hosted instance directly from the main instance. Click *Hosted Plugin* element in the status bar, and a context menu with available actions will be displayed. You will be able to stop and restart the running hosted Che-Theia instance. When a hosted instance is stopped, the context menu can be used to start it.

== Using code completion

There is a full code completion provided to help you write your plug-in. Code completion covers both the Che-Theia plug-in API and the Che plug-in API.

.Code-completion example
[example]
====
Your plug-in will handle the opening of a document and displaying a notification message when the document is opened.
