= Adding a Che-Theia plug-in into a workspace

There are three ways to add a Che-Theia plug-in into the Che-Theia IDE:

* Using the Che-Theia dashboard
* By configuring a workspace
* At runtime

[id="adding-a-plug-in-by-configuring-a-workspace_{context}"]
== Adding a plug-in by configuring a workspace

This method is useful when you need to add plug-ins from a non-default registry.

. Navigate to the *Workspaces* tab in the dashboard.
. Select the workspace to which you want to add the plug-in.
. Switch to the *Config* tab, and find the `attributes.plugins` section.

+
Plug-ins are separated by commas (`,`).
. To add plug-ins, append new records after the separator. A record has the following format:
+
----
 <registry-base-uri>/plugins/<plugin-name>:<version>
----
+
Examples:
+
* pass:[https://custom-registry/plugins/org.name.plugin.theia:1.0.0]
* pass:[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/che-custom-plugins/master/plugins/org.name.plugin.theia:0.0.1]


[id="adding-a-plug-in-at-runtime_{context}"]
== Adding a plug-in at runtime

This method adds a plug-in to an already running workspace. The plug-in is not added permanently; it is removed when the workspace stops. This is a good method to test a plug-in without affecting the permanent workspace configuration.

. Run the `Deploy Plugin by Id` command, and specify the ID of the plug-in that you want to add to the workspace. A plug-in ID can be:
+
** A local directory with plug-ins. All the plug-in binaries (`.theia` files) in the specified directory would be loaded. Example: `local-dir:///home/theia/plugins/`.

** VS Code extension link. To obtain the link, go to the VS Code marketplace, find the needed extension, copy its ID, and append the ID to the `vscode:extension/` prefix.
+
For example, for the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml[XML language server] plug-in, it is: `vscode:extension/redhat.vscode-xml`.

** Link to plug-in binaries (`.theia` files). Can be both HTTP and HTTPS. Example: `https://domain.net/path/plugin.theia`.

To check if the plug-in loaded successful, open the *Plugins panel* (*View* > *Plugins* in the main menu) and search for the plug-in in the list.
