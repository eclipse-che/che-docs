= Sharing your Che-Theia plug-in with a factory

This section describes how to use a Che-Theia factory to share a plug-in in development environment with other users.


[id="sharing-a-factory-with-a-plug-in-development-environment_{context}"]
== Sharing a factory with a plug-in development environment

This approach brings an advantage of other users being able to contribute to the development, provided they have write access to the repository with the plug-in.

. Create a factory with the plug-in development environment, and share it. The reviewers get the exact same environment. They must then build and run the plug-in to test it (a script or instructions on how to build should be included in the plug-in repository).

. The reviewer should start a hosted plug-in instance and specify the path to the plug-in project inside the workspace. For instructions on how to start a hosted instance of Che-Theia for plug-in testing, see xref:testing-che-theia-plug-ins_extending-{prod-id-short}[].

. To make the reviewers' work easier, it is possible to invoke a command to build the plug-in after the loading of the factory is completed. For more details, see the factory documentation.

[id="sharing-a-factory-with-plug-in-configuration_{context}"]
== Sharing a factory with plug-in configuration

This method provides a workspace with a ready-to-use plug-in. The author of the plug-in must host the plug-in binaries in a custom registry.
// TODO: custom plug0in registry (link:link[LINK]).

. Create a factory.
. Go to the factory details, and scroll to the *Configuration* section.
. Add the plug-in to the `workspace.attributes.plugins` field.

. Share the factory link.

WARNING: Only accept factories from trusted sources. Malicious factories can potentially steal data that is accessible from within your workspace.
