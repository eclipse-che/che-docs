= Adding a Che-Theia plug-in to the {prod-short} plug-in registry

To have a Che-Theia plug-in available in the default {prod-short} plug-in registry, submit a pull request to the registry GitHub repository.

.Prerequisites

* Che-Theia plug-in definition file: `meta.yaml`


.Procedure

. Submit a PR with the `meta.yaml` file of your Che-Theia plug-in in the `v3/plugins/<your-plugin-group>/<your-plugin-name>/<version>/` directory to the {prod-short} plug-in registry GitHub repository at link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry/[che-plugin-registry].
+
For example, SonarLint Che-Theia plug-in is located in the `v3/plugins/sonarsource/sonarlint-vscode/0.0.1/meta.yaml` file.

// TODO: Add a sample PR adding a plug-in to the registry.

After the new Che-Theia plug-ins are added and merged into the repository, the list of available plug-ins in the registry is updated.
