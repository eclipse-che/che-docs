= Che-Theia plug-in registries

A plug-in registry is a simple service that hosts information (metadata) about the plug-ins.

To retrieve a full list of plug-ins hosted in a registry, navigate to the following address: `<registry-base-uri>/plugins/index.json`.

Each plug-in item in the list is represented by a JSON definition:

    "id": "che-dummy-plugin",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "type": "{prod-short} Plugin",
    "name": "{prod-short} Samples Hello World Plugin",
    "description": "A hello world theia plug-in wrapped into a {prod-short} Plug-in",
    "links": {
        "self": "/plugins/che-dummy-plugin/0.0.1/meta.yaml"                  <1>
 }
----
<1> Points to a more complete plug-in description (`meta.yaml`).

----
<1> Points to the plug-in configuration. Typically, it is a TAR archive with the plug-in YAML file. It is also possible to have a link to the raw content of a plug-in YAML file.

For a VS Code extension, the `url` field is replaced with an `attributes` section.

attributes:
extension: "vscode:extension/extension.id"             <1>
container-image: "my.docker.registry/remote-theia:tag" <2>
----
<1> VS Code extension ID with a `vscode:extension/` prefix
<2> Points to a container image in which the extension runs. Note that the image should contain an appropriate Node.js version with installed dependencies for Che-Theia remote plug-ins.

[id="official-plug-in-registry_{context}"]
== Official plug-in registry

The official {prod-short} plug-in registry is at link:https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io[che-plugin-registry.openshift.io]. By default, the {prod-short} dashboard shows editors and plug-ins from this registry.

The source is located at link: https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry[github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry].


[id="custom-plug-in-registries_{context}"]
== Custom plug-in registries

For more information about setting up a custom registry, see the description of the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry[official registry repository].

There are two ways of using plug-ins from a custom registry:

* Specify a link to the plug-in in the configuration of a workspace. See xref:adding-a-plug-in-by-configuring-a-workspace_publishing-{prod-id-short}-theia-plug-ins[Adding a plug-in into a workspace via configuration].

* Replace the default official registry with a custom one in your {prod-short} instance. To do that, set the `PLUGIN_REGISTRY_IMAGE` environment variable in your {prod-short} configuration. Note that plug-ins from the official registry are not available from the dashboard interface. To include them, add references into your registry from the official registry.
