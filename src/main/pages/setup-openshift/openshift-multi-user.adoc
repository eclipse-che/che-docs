== Deploying Che on supported OpenShift flavors and versions

Multi-user Eclipse Che can be deployed to OpenShift Container Platform 3.6 and later, OpenShift Dedicated, and OpenShift Online Pro.

The deployment script creates three DeploymentConfigs for Che, Postgres, and Keycloak. PVCs, services, and routes (Che and Keycloak only) are also created by the deployment script.

== Using Minishift to Deploy Che

Due to the size of a multi-user Eclipse Che installation, Minishift is not recommended as the base for this configuration. If you have to use Minishift, start it with at least 4GB of memory by including the `--memory=4096` parameter, and https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/updating.html[update Minishift] to the latest version.
