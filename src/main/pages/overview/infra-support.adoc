== Introduction

Eclipse Che runs on several infrastructures and container engines:


* Docker
* OpenShift: *https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/index.html[OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)]*, *https://www.openshift.com/features/index.html[OpenShift Online (OSO)]*, *https://access.redhat.com/products/openshift-dedicated-red-hat/[OpenShift Dedicated (OCD)]*, *https://www.openshift.org/minishift/[MiniShift]*
* Kubernetes

=== Available features for different infrastructures

|===
| Feature | *Available on Docker* | *Available on OpenShift* | *Available on Kubernetes* |
|root access | yes | yes (See: link:openshift-config.html#enable-ssh-and-sudo[Configuration]) | yes |
|https | no | yes (See: link:openshift-config.html#https-mode[Configuration]) | yes |
|scalability | no | yes (See: link:openshift-config.html#scalability[Configuration]) | yes |
|privileged containers | yes | yes (configurable in https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/admin_guide/manage_scc.html#grant-access-to-the-privileged-scc[OpenShift]) | yes |
|health checks | no | yes | yes |
|persistent preview URLs | no | yes | yes |
|installers | yes | yes (some installers may require link:openshift-config.html#enable-ssh-and-sudo[sudo access]) | yes |
|file system permissions | not limited | limited to directories owned by root link:openshift-config.html#filesystem-permissions[group] | not limited |
|===
*Root Access:* You can have root access in workspace containers, which allows you to run system services and to install software at runtime.

*Privileged Containers* You can run workspace containers in a link:docker-config.html#privileged-mode[privileged mode].

== Docker versus Openshift for running Che

Che on Docker is not scalable because you can not add more nodes to run workspaces. You can use a large instance with 8 CPUs or more and 32+ RAM.  A potential problem is that the instance can be unresponsive when it has a large number of running containers with heavy processes running in them. This affects the workspace master and all running workspaces.

Che on Docker is simpler to deploy but these features are only available on OpenShift:

*HTTPS support*

HAProxy runs in an OpenShift cluster and creates secure routes.

*Scalability*

You can add nodes depending on the demand to run workspaces. OpenShift schedules workspaces to available nodes.

*Health Checks*

OpenShift restarts failed deployments and offers health checks for pods. This can significantly minimize the effect of infrastructure outages.

*Persistent Preview URLs*

You can access applications and processes in Che workspaces.  Che creates services and routes that are persistent URLs.
