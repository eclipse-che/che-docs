Eclipse Che is available in two different modes: single-user and multi-user.

**Single-user Che**

To use Che on your local machine or to evaluate the platform, start with single-user Che. The advantages of using single-user Che are:

* The command line interface pulls fewer images.
* The user dashboard is quickly available because no login is required.

Single-user Che does not provide multi-tenancy nor permissions for entities such as workspaces. Che server and workspaces are not secure with single-user Che. 

.Additional Resources

* To run Che in single-user mode using Docker, see link:docker-single-user[Single-user on Docker]. 

* To run Che in single-user mode using OpenShift, see link:openshift-single-user[Single-user on OpenShift].

**Multi-user Che**

Multi-user Che provides multi-tenancy. Che uses http://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak] to register, manage, and authenticate users. Keycloak tokens provide security for user accounts and workspaces. The Permissions API regulates access to different entities such as workspaces, stacks, recipes, and organizations. User information is stored in a persistent PostgreSQL database, which supports migrations.

The advantages of using multi-user Che are:

* The fully functional web IDE supports precise access controls.
* The standalone Keycloak server supports user federation and identity providers.

By default, Che deploys in single-user mode for Docker and OpenShift. You can use special flags to enable multi-user functionality.
