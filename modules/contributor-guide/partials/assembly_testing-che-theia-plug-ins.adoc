:context: testing-che-theia-plug-ins

Developers can test how plug-ins work while working on them by running Che-Theia in the hosted mode. It is a special mode in which Che-Theia loads your plug-in directly from the `/projects` directory (as opposed to the rest of the plug-ins, which are loaded from the plug-in registry). The Che-Theia hosted mode is similar to the debug mode in VS Code.

== Starting a hosted Che-Theia instance

. Press F1 to display the command palette, and run the `Hosted Plugin: Start Instance` command.

. Specify the path to the plug-in. A new browser tab is opened.

.Status in the hosted instance

When running in the hosted mode, Che-Theia displays a *Development Host* message in the status bar. When you hover your mouse over the message, a tip is displayed with the name of the hosted plug-in.

.Status in the main instance
At the same time, the main instance of Che-Theia displays a *Hosted Plugin* message in the status bar. This element indicates the state of the hosted instance. After starting the hosted instance, main Che-Theia begins to watch the code changes.

When you change something in your plug-in, you can switch to the hosted Che-Theia instance, refresh the page, and immediately see the results.

.Plug-in output

When you run a hosted instance, the main Che-Theia instance opens the *Output* view. This view contains all the output from the `yarn` back-end process. It also contains the output of the back-end plug-in that is being developed.

== Controlling a hosted Che-Theia instance

You can control the state of the hosted instance directly from the main instance. Click *Hosted Plugin* element in the status bar, and a pop-up menu with the available actions is displayed. You can stop and restart the running hosted Che-Theia instance from the pop-up menu. When a hosted instance is stopped, use the pop-up menu to start it again.

== Using code completion

Code completion feature helps you write your plug-in. Code completion covers both the `Che Editor` plug-in API and the `Che Plugin` plug-in API.

.Code-completion example
[example]
====
Your plug-in will handle the opening of a document and displaying a notification message when the document is opened.
