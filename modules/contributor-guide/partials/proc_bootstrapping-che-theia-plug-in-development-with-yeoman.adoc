= Bootstrapping a Che-Theia plug-in development with Yeoman

Two methods are available to scaffold a new plug-in development environment in Che-Theia:

* Console plug-in generator (based on the Yeoman generator).
* *Yeoman wizard* (launched from the command palette).


[id="list-of-available-plug-in-samples_{context}"]
== List of available plug-in samples

The Che-Theia plug-in generator provides several predefined samples:

* *Hello World plug-in*: The plug-in registers a new Che-Theia command. When the user launches this command, Che-Theia displays a notification with the `Hello World` message. The example illustrates how to define and use commands in Che-Theia.

* *Skeleton plug-in*: The plug-in prints the current Che-Theia window state in the browser log.

* *Samples plug-in*: The plug-in contains examples of how to use the Che-Theia API:

** Commands sample: The plug-in shows how to define a Che-Theia command with arguments. Command arguments are useful when another plug-in needs to call a command with parameters.

** Information message sample: An example of how to define and show a modal information message.

** Quick-pick sample: An example of how to define a command list with items and a handler for a selected item.

** Status-bar item sample: An example of how to apply information to the status bar. The status bar is a widget located at the bottom of the Che-Theia window (a footer).


[id="generating-plug-ins-overview_{context}"]
== Overview of generating plug-ins

To simplify plug-in development, there is a plug-in generator (`@theia/generator-plugin`) for creating new plug-ins from scratch. The plug-in generator provides the *Yeoman wizard* for a step-by-step plug-in generation:

. Choose project name for the future plug-in.
. Select plug-in type. The Che-Theia plug-in API has two plug-in types:
+
--
** frontend: The plug-in works on the client side
** back end: The plug-in works on the server side
--
+
During plug-in creation, you need to decide the purpose of the plug-in and, accordingly, select the plug-in type.

. Select a plug-in sample.

//*TODO* Apply stack for development: For plug-in development inside Eclipse CHE You could use any stack, but apply theia-dev plug-in. This stack contains installed npm, node, git and preinstalled `@theia/generator-plugin.`


[id="installing-the-plug-in-generator_{context}"]
== Installing the plug-in generator

. Run the following command to install the plug-in generator:
+
----
$ yarn global add yo @theia/generator-plugin
----

. Check that the `@theia/plugin` generator is available:
+
----
$ yo --help
----
+
The command returns a list of pre-installed generators.


[id="generating-a-new-plug-in-in-the-console_{context}"]
== Generating a new plug-in in the console

. Create a new terminal inside your workspace using the *Terminal* menu, and run the plug-in generator:
+
----
$ yo @theia/plugin
----
+
Alternatively, run `yo` without any parameters and select the `@theia/plugin` generator from the list of available generators.
+
image::extensibility/yo-select-plug-in-generator.png[link="../_images/extensibility/yo-select-plug-in-generator.png"]

. Enter the information to configure the plug-in. For example:
+
image::extensibility/launching-console-plug-in-generator.png[link="../_images/extensibility/launching-console-plug-in-generator.png"]

When the plug-in is generated, it appears in the *Files* panel. The sample is already compiled and contains the plug-in binary file. In this example, the plug-in binary file is named `my_first_plugin.theia`.


[id="generating-a-new-plug-in-using-the-yeoman-wizard_{context}"]
== Generating a new plug-in using the Yeoman wizard

{prod-short}-theia provides the `Yeoman wizard` command for creating new plug-ins from the command palette.

. To open the command palette, press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+p] (or kbd:[Cmd+Shift+p] on macOS).

. Type `Yeom` to filter the commands. Select the `Yeoman Wizard` command.
+
image::extensibility/yeoman-wizard-launching.png[link="../_images/extensibility/yeoman-wizard-launching.png"]
+
Note that launching the wizard may take a few seconds.

. Enter the new project name.
+
image::extensibility/yeoman-wizard-choosing-plug-in-name.png[link="../_images/extensibility/yeoman-wizard-choosing-plug-in-name.png"]

. Select the desired plug-in type (client-side or server-side).
+
image::extensibility/yeoman-wizard-choosing-plug-in-type.png[link="../_images/extensibility/yeoman-wizard-choosing-plug-in-type.png"]

. Select the plug-in sample to use.
+
image::extensibility/yeoman-wizard-choosing-plug-in-sample.png[link="../_images/extensibility/yeoman-wizard-choosing-plug-in-sample.png"]

When the plug-in is generated, the *Yeoman wizard* displays a notification.

image::extensibility/yeoman-wizard-plug-in-generated.png[link="../_images/extensibility/yeoman-wizard-plug-in-generated.png"]

The plug-in sample displays in the *Files* panel. Use the *Output* tab in the bottom panel to access logs for plug-in generation.

NOTE: The *Yeoman wizard* only works when a workspace is opened in Che-Theia.
