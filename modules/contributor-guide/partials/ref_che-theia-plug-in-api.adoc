:context: che-theia-plug-in-api

The Che-Theia plug-in API consists of two {namespace}s:

[options="header"]
|===
| Namespace | Description
| `theia` | Provides a Che-Theia IDE-related API that allows to interact with its different components
| `che` | Provides a plug-in API to access parts of the {prod-short} API
|===


[id="theia-{namespace}_{context}"]
== `theia` {namespace}

The available resources of the `theia` {namespace} are described in the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theia-ide/theia/master/packages/plugin/src/theia.d.ts[`theia.d.ts`] file in the link:https://github.com/theia-ide/theia[Theia repository]. The root of the {namespace} contains types declaration and the following API sections:

|===
| `commands` | API for adding new and executing existing Che-Theia commands
| `debug` | API for debugger configuration and debugger events
| `env` | API for accessing environment variables and query parameters of the Che-Theia IDE
| `languages` | API and events related to language support; typically is used by language servers
| `languageServer` (experimental) | API for language-server integration
| `plugins` | API for retrieving information about loaded plug-ins
| `tasks` | API for providing custom task runners
| `window` | API to control visual components of the IDE. It allows to manipulate the editor tabs, terminals, status bar, and so on. The section contains events for changing the state of selected components and the whole IDE. Dialog popups.
| `workspace` | API related to the Che-Theia workspace with information about the current workspace state, documents in it, file-related operations including watching, finding, and so on. The section contains state-change events.
|===


[id="{prod-id-short}-{namespace}_{context}"]
== `che` {namespace}

NOTE: Many APIs in the {namespace} are experimental and can change in the future.

Available resources of the `che` {orch-namespace} are described in the `extensions/eclipse-che-theia-plugin/src/che.d.ts` file in the link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-theia[Che-Theia repository].

This {namespace} contains APIs and types related to {prod-short}. Some sections are a bridge to {prod-short} API. The following is a list of the sections:

|===
| factory | Allows to work with the {prod-short} factory API; provides functionality to retrieve specified factory configuration
| task | Allows to add {prod-short}-aware commands ({prod-short}-specific attributes, such as workspace ID or container name, are accessible from within task implementation)
| variables | Allows to add a variable resolver
| workspace | Allows to work with the {prod-short} workspace API; provides functionality to access workspaces, their lifecycle, and user settings.

== Using the `che` {orch-namespace} in plug-ins

VS Code extensions::
+
. Adding the `@eclipse-che/plugin` dependency for backend plug-ins to a `package.json` file is a possibility.
. For quick calls, it is simpler to use VS Code extension mechanism because it does not require relying on a third-party party dependency or trying and catching the error.
+
. Import and use the {orch-namespace}. For example:
+
[source,typescript]
----
const eclipseCheExtPlugin = vscode.extensions.getExtension('@eclipse-che.ext-plugin');
if (eclipseCheExtPlugin) {
  // grab user
  const user = await eclipseCheExtPlugin.exports.user.getCurrentUser();
 vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Eclipse Che user information: id ${user.id} with name ${user.name}`);
} else {
  vscode.window.showWarningMessage('Not running inside Eclipse Che, not displaying any user information');
}

== Using the `che` {orch-namespace} in plug-ins

Backend plug-in::
+
. Add the `@eclipse-che/plugin` dependency to a plug-in `package.json` file.
+
. Import and use the {orch-namespace}. For example:
+
[source,typescript]
----
import * as che from '@eclipse-che/plugin';

const wsConfig = che.workspace.getById(workspaceID);
----

Frontend plug-in::
+
. Perform the same steps as for a back-end plug-in.
+
. Modify the `externals` section in `webpack.config.js` by adding the `@eclipse-che/plugin` key with the following value: `che.<your_plugin_ID>` (copy the `@theia/plugin` value, and substitute `theia.` for `che.`). For example:
+
[source,javascript]
----
externals: {
   "@theia/plugin": "theia.theia_test_api",
   "@eclipse-che/plugin": "che.theia_test_api"
 }
----

NOTE: It is possible to add a new API {namespace} for plug-ins using a separate extension.
