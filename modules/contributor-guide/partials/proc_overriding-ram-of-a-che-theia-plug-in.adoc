= Overriding RAM of a Che-Theia plug-in

Sometimes, a plug-in consumes more memory than what has been allocated to it by the plug-in author or {prod-short} defaults. An example of such a case is the use of a language server with a project that has many source files (&8gt; 10 000). RAM consumption in such circumstances needs to be tuned, otherwise the machine that runs the {prod-short} workspaces kills the process with an out-of-memory error (OOM) error.


.Procedure

Users can override the RAM limit and request for a particular plug-in in their workspace configuration.

* Set the `memoryLimit` and/or `memoryRequest` for devfile component  to `1000M` or `10Gi`, or any other value formatted as a number and a unit (`b, k, ki, m, mi, g, gi`). When no unit is specified, the number is in bytes.

NOTE: Using this notation, units that contain the character `i`, denote a number that is of the power 2, such as 1024 (as opposed to numbers that use a power of 10, such as 1000).

.Limiting RAM use for a plug-in
[example]
====
For the YAML language server plug-in, sets the RAM limit to 768 mebibytes (1073741824 bytes) and RAM request to 500 megabytes:

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  - id: redhat/vscode-yaml/latest
    type: chePlugin
    memoryLimit: 768mi
    memoryRequest: 500M
----
====

.Limiting CPU use for a plug-in
[example]
====
For the YAML language server plug-in, sets the CPU limit to 1.5 cores and CPU request to 500 millicores:

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  - id: redhat/vscode-yaml/latest
    type: chePlugin
    cpuLimit: 1.5
    cpuRequest: 500m
----
