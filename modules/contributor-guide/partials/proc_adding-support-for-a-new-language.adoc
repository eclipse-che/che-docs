= Adding support for a new language

This section describes how to add support for a new language into {prod}. 

The described method is to write a Che-Theia plug-in that uses the _languageserver-node_ library to connect a language server to the Visual Studio Code extension API. Note that it is also possible to directly connect a Che-Theia plug-in or a Visual Studio Code extension to the plug-in API. 

.Prerequisites
* Install the latest Che-Theia plug-in Yeoman generator. Follow the documentation about xref:developing-che-theia-plug-ins.adoc[].
 
.Procedure

. Generate a sample by running the `yo @theia/plugin` command. When prompted, confirm the choices for *Backend plug-in*, *Samples*, and then *Language sample*. This creates a project and a ready-to-use plug-in, which provides support for XML Language Server and can be deployed.

. Replace the download URL of the implementation of the language server protocol in the `src/download-xml-ls.js` file. This file will be downloaded during the build process of the plug-in. If the name of `src/download-xml-ls.js` changed, replace it in the `package.json` file in the `scripts` block.

. Replace the configuration of the language in the `src/language-configuration.json` file. This file contains configuration options for the current language. If the name of `src/language-configuration.json` changed, replace it in the `package.json` file in the `contribution` block.

. Replace the configuration of the language in the `src/xml.tmLanguage.json` file. This file describes syntax highlighting. If the name of `src/xml.tmLanguage.json` changed, replace it in the `package.json` file in the `contribution.grammars` block.

. Replace the information about the provided language in the `src/plug-in_name.ts` file. This file contains information about the location of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation and the command with arguments to run it.

. Build the plug-in by running `yarn` in the root of the project.
