= Che-Theia plug-in registries

A plug-in registry is a simple service that hosts metadata about the enabled plug-ins.

To retrieve a full list of plug-ins hosted in a registry, navigate to the `<registry-base-uri>/v3/plugins/index.json` file.

Each plug-in item in the list is represented by a JSON definition.

== Custom plug-in registries

For more information about setting up a custom registry, see the description of the link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-plugin-registry[official registry repository].

To use plug-ins from a custom registry, follow one of the following methods:

* Specify a link to the plug-in in the configuration of a workspace. See xref:adding-a-plug-in-by-configuring-a-workspace_{context}[Adding a plug-in into a workspace using the workspace configuration].

* Replace the default official registry with a custom one in your {prod-short} instance. To do so, set the `PLUGIN_REGISTRY_IMAGE` environment variable in your {prod-short} configuration. Note that plug-ins from the official registry are not available from the dashboard interface. To include them, add references to your registry from the official registry.
