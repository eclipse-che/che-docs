= super-privileged mode

The *manageSystem* permission can be extended to provide a *super-privileged* mode. This allows the user to perform advanced actions on any resources managed by the system. A user can read and stop any workspace with the *manageSystem* permission and assign permissions to other users as needed.

The *super-privileged* mode is disabled by default. To change to the *super-privileged* mode, set the `+CHE_SYSTEM_SUPER__PRIVILEGED__MODE+` environment variable to `true`. The list of services that are enabled for users with the *manageSystems* permissions and with *super-privileged* mode on:
