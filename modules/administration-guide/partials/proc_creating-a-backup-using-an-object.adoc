This section describes how to create backups of {prod-short} using Custom Resource objects.

WARNING: This procedure does not back up the content of users' workspaces. To back up the content of users' workspaces, see xref:managing-backups-of-persistent-volumes.adoc[Managing backups of persistent volumes].

.Prerequisites

* xref:setup-backup-server.adoc[A backup server is set up].

* xref:define-backup-server-for-operator.adoc[{prod-short} Operator is configured to use the backup server].

.Procedure

. Create a `CheClusterBackup` backup object to create a backup:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: org.eclipse.che/v1
kind: CheClusterBackup
metadata:
  name: {prod-short}-backup
spec:
  backupServerConfigRef: backup-server-configuration <1>
----
<1> Name of the `CheBackupServerConfiguration` object defining what backup server to use.

. Read the `status` section of the `CheClusterBackup` object to verify the backup process:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
status:
  message: 'Backup is in progress. Start time: <timestamp>' <1>
  stage: Collecting {prod-short} installation data          <2>
  state: InProgress                                         <3>
  snapshotId: ba92c7e0                                      <4>
----
<1> Displays the overall state or error message.
<2> Current phase of the backup process in a human-readable format.
<3> Backup process state. One of `InProgress`, `Succeeded`, or `Failed`.
<4> ID of the created backup snapshot. The field appears only when `state` is `Succeeded`.

[NOTE]
====
To reuse the name of an existing backup object for a new backup object, delete the old object:

[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
{orch-cli} delete CheClusterBackup _<name>_ -n {prod-namespace}
