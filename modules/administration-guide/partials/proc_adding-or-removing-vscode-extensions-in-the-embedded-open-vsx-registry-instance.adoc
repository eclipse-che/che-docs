= Adding or removing pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = NO -->] pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = NO -->] VS Code pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = YES -->] pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = YES -->] extensions in the embedded Open VSX registry instance

You can add or remove your choice of pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = NO -->] pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = NO -->] VS Code pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = YES -->] pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = YES -->] extensions in the embedded Open VSX registry instance that is deployed by {prod-short} to support air-gapped, offline, and proxy-restricted environments.

This will create a custom build of the Open VSX registry, which can be used in your organizationâ€™s workspaces. 

TIP: To get the latest security fixes and updates after a {prod-short} update, you can build a new registry container that is based on the updated {prod-short} container.

** If the extension is published on link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org], you can add its extension `id` in the format __<published_by>__.__<unique_identifier>__. You can find the `id` on the extension's listing page on link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org].

    {
        "id": "__<published_by>__.__<unique_identifier>__"
    }
----

[TIP]
====
The latest extension version on link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org] is the default. Alternatively, you can add `"version": "__<extension_version>__"` on a new line to specify a version.
====

** If the extension is only available from link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode[Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace], but not link:https://open-vsx.org[Open VSX], you can ask the extension publisher to also publish it on link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org] according to these link:https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Publishing-Extensions#how-to-publish-an-extension[instructions], potentially using this link:https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-vs-code-extension[GitHub action].
+
[TIP]
====
* If the extension publisher is unavailable or unwilling to publish the extension to link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org], and if there is no Open VSX equivalent of the extension, consider link:https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/issues[reporting an issue] to the Open VSX team.

* If you have a closed-source extension or an extension developed only for internal use in your company, you can add the extension directly from a `.vsix` file that is accessible from a URL while building the plugin registry container:
+
[source,json,subs="+quotes"]
----
    {
        "id": "__<published_by>__.__<unique_identifier>__",
        "download": "__<url_to_download_vsix_file>__",
        "version": "__<extension_version>__"
    }
----
====
+
WARNING: The link:https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU[Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace Terms of Use] do not permit downloading extensions from link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode[Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace] for use in Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source that is loaded in your organization's workspaces.

** You can remove the extension by deleting it from the `openvsx-sync.json` file.

. Build the plugin registry container image and publish it to a container registry like link:https://quay.io/[quay.io]:

.. {empty}
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ ./build.sh -o __<username>__ -r quay.io -t custom
----

.. {empty}
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {docker-cli} push quay.io/__<username/plugin_registry:custom>__
----

. Edit the `CheCluster` custom resource in the cluster to point to the image (for example, on link:https://quay.io/[quay.io]) and then save the changes:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spec:
  components:
    pluginRegistry:
      deployment:
        containers:
          - image: quay.io/__<username/plugin_registry:custom>__
      openVSXURL: '' 
----

. Check that the `plugin-registry` pod has restarted and is running.

. Restart the workspace and check the available extensions in the *Extensions* view of the Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source in the workspace.
