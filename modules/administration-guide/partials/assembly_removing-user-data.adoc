== GDPR

In case user data needs to be deleted, the following API should be used with the `user` or the `admin` authorization token:

```
curl -X DELETE `http(s)://{che-host}/api/user/{id}`
```

NOTE: All the user's workspaces should be stopped beforehand. Otherwise, the API request will fail with `500` Error.

To remove the data of all the users, follow instructions for xref:installation-guide:uninstalling-che.adoc[].
