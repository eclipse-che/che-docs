== GDPR

In case user data needs to be deleted, the following API should be used with the `user` or the `admin` authorization token:

[subs="+attributes"]
----
$ curl -X DELETE `http(s)://{prod-host}/api/user/\{id}`
----
NOTE: For deletening all data releted to the user account from Keycloak need to set `che.keycloak.cascade_user_removal_enabled` to the `true`.
For correct work need to set admin username `che.keycloak.admin_username` and password
`che.keycloak.admin_password`. 

NOTE: By default this feature is disabled. 

NOTE: All the user's workspaces should be stopped beforehand. Otherwise, the API request will fail with `500` Error.

To remove the data of all the users, follow instructions for xref:installation-guide:uninstalling-che.adoc[].
