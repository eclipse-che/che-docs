= External PostgreSQL setup

By default, the {prod-short} Operator creates and manages deployment of the internal PostgreSQL database. However, the {prod-short} Operator does not support full lifecycle capabilities such as backups and recovery.

A business-critical setup must use an external PostgreSQL database that is configured:

* for High Availability (HA) and Point In Time Recovery (PITR)

* on-premises or using a cloud service such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)

For example, Amazon RDS enables deployment of production databases in a Multi-Availability Zone configuration for a resilient disaster recovery strategy with daily and on-demand snapshots.

An example configuration is as follows:

[options="header"]
|===
|Parameter | Value
|Instance class | db.t2.small
|vCPU | 1
|RAM | 2 GB
|Multi-az | true, 2 replicas
|Engine version | 9.6.11
|TLS | enabled
|Automated backups | enabled (30 days)
|===

You can make workspace metadata and user information persistent by configuring the external PostgreSQL database and configuring {prod-short} to use the configured external PostgreSQL database:

* xref:configuring-{prod-id-short}-to-work-with-the-external-postgresql_{context}[]
