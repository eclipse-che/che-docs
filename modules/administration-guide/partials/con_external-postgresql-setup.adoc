= External PostgreSQL setup

The {prod-short} server uses a PostgreSQL database for persisting data about the state of {prod-short}. The database contains information about user accounts, workspaces, preferences, and other details.

By default, the {prod-short} Operator creates and manages deployment of this database. However, the {prod-short} Operator does not support full life-cycle capabilities such as backups and recovery.

The following disaster-recovery options are recommended when configuring an external PostgreSQL database for a business-critical setup:

* High Availability (HA)
* Point In Time Recovery (PITR)

The external PostgreSQL instance can be configured as on-premises or to use a cloud service such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). Amazon RDS enables deployment of production databases in a Multi-Availability Zone configuration for a resilient disaster recovery strategy with daily and on-demand snapshots.

The recommended configuration of an example database:

[options="header"]
|===
|Parameter | Value
|Instance class | db.t2.small
|vCPU | 1
|RAM | 2 GB
|Multi-az | true, 2 replicas
|Engine version | 9.6.11
|TLS | enabled
|Automated backups | enabled (30 days)
|===

Making workspace metadata and user information persistent involves configuring both the external PostgreSQL and Che:
