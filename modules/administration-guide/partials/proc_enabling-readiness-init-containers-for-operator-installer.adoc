= Enabling the readiness init containers for the Operator installer

The readiness init containers are not enabled by default, so to use them you first have to enable them. To enable the readiness init containers for {prod-short} installed by the Operator installer:

.Prerequisites

* {prod} installed by the Operator installer.

.Procedure

. Find {prod-short} Operator Deployment name.

. Edit the Deployment as follows: Under `spec.template.spec.containers[0].env` of the Operator Deployment, insert the following lines with the `ADD_COMPONENT_READINESS_INIT_CONTAINERS` environment variable:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
 - name: ADD_COMPONENT_READINESS_INIT_CONTAINERS
   value: "true"
----

. Wait while {prod-short} Operator restarts some components.

NOTE: Repeat these steps after each {prod-short} upgrade when a new Operator Deployment is created.
