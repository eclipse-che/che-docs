.High-level {prod-short} architecture with the {devworkspace} operator
image::architecture/che-interacting-with-devworkspace.png[]

When {prod-short} is running with the {devworkspace} operator, it runs on three groups of components:

{prod-short} server components::
Manage User {orch-namespace} and workspaces. The main component is the User dashboard, from which users control their workspaces.

{devworkspace} operator::
Creates and controls the necessary {orch-name} objects to run User workspaces. Including `Pods`, `Services`, and `PeristentVolumes`.

User workspaces:: 
Container-based development environments, the IDE included.

The role of these {orch-name} features is central:

{devworkspace} Custom Resources::
Valid {orch-name} objects representing the User workspaces and manipulated by {prod-short}. It is the communication channel for the three groups of components.

{orch-name} role-based access control (RBAC):: 
Controls access to all resources.
