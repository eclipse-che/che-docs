.High-level {prod-short} architecture with the {devworkspace} engine
image::architecture/che-interacting-with-devworkspace.png[]

When {prod-short} is running with the {devworkspace} engine, it runs on three groups of components. The {prod-short} server components and the {devworkspace} engine are the two central server-side components of {prod-short}. Together they manage the User workspaces, which are container-based development environments.

The {prod-short} dashboard controls the desired state of the User workspaces and displays the running workspaces.

The {devworkspace} engine manages the running state of the User workspaces.
The {devworkspace} engine stops a workspace after 30 minutes of inactivity. This duration is configurable.

The User dashboard and the {devworkspace} engine communicate with valid {orch-name} objects: {devworkspace} Custom Resources.

{orch-name} role-based access control (RBAC) controls access to the workspaces
