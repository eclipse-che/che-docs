:context: calculating-{prod-id-short}-resource-requirements

This section describes how to calculate resources, such as memory and CPU, required to run {prod}.

Both the {prod-short} central controller and user workspaces consist of a set of containers. Those containers contribute to the resources consumption in terms of CPU and RAM limits and requests.
