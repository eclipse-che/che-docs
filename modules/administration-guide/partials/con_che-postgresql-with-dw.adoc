[id="{prod-id-short}-postgresql_{context}"]
= {prod-short} and PostgreSQL (in the DevWorkspace context)

The PostgreSQL database is a {prod-short} prerequisite. The {prod-short} administrator can choose to connect {prod-short} to an existing PostgreSQL instance or let the {prod-short} deployment start a new dedicated PostgreSQL instance.

The {prod-id-short}-server uses the database to persist user configurations (workspaces metadata, Git credentials).
