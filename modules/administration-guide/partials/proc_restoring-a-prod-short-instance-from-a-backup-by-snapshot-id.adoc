.Prerequisites

* A backup. See xref:managing-backups-of-prod-short-instances-using-prod-cli.adoc#creating-a-backup-of-a-prod-short-instance-using-prod-cli_{context}[Creating a backup using {prod-cli}].

* The ID of the backup snapshot.
//Here we need to ask the author how we as the user can obtain such snapshot ID (for example, are there any commands that list snapshot IDs? Let me check if creating a snapshot outputs its ID, but the reader will still need to view a list of snapshots to choose from. max-cx

.Procedure

* Run the following command with the backup snapshot ID specified using the `--snapshot-id=` option:
