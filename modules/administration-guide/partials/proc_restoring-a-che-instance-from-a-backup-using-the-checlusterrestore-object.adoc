= Restoring a {prod-short} instance from a backup using the CheClusterRestore custom object

You can restore a {prod-short} instance from a backup snapshot using custom resouces. A new `CheClusterRestore` custom object is required every time you restore a {prod-short} instance from a backup snapshot; that is, editing an already consumed `CheClusterRestore` custom object, during or after backing up, has no effect.

.Prerequisites

* Backup snapshot of a {prod-short} instance on any of the following:
** xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-a-rest-backup-server.adoc[External REST backup server]
** xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-an-sftp-backup-server.adoc[External SFTP backup server]
** xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-amazon-s3.adoc[Amazon S3]
** xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-the-internal-backup-server.adoc[Internal backup server]

.Procedure

. Create the `CheClusterRestore` custom object, which restores a backup:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
apiVersion: org.eclipse.che/v1
kind: CheClusterRestore
metadata:
  name: {prod-id}-restore
  namespace: {prod-namespace}
spec:
  backupServerConfigRef: backup-server-configuration <1>
  snapshotId: _<snapshot_id>_ <2>
----
<1> Name of the `CheBackupServerConfiguration` object that defines what backup server to use.
<2> Optional parameter defining the Snapshot ID to restore from. The default value is the last snapshot in the backup repository on the backup server.
+
[TIP]
====
If you intend to reuse a `name` for `CheClusterRestore` custom objects, first make sure to delete any existing custom object with the same `name`. To delete it on the command line, use {orch-cli}:
[source,shell,subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} delete CheClusterRestore _<name>_ -n {prod-namespace}
----
====

. Wait until the recovery process ends.
+
TIP: If errors occur in your browser after the recovery, clean up the browser data for the {prod-short} domain.

. Read the `status` section of the `CheClusterRestore` object to verify the recovery process:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
status:
  message: 'Restore is in progress. Start time: <timestamp>' <1>
  stage: Restoring {prod-short} related cluster objects <2>
  state: InProgress <3>
----
<1> Overall state or error message.
<2> Current phase of the recovery process in a human-readable format.
<3> Recovery process state. One of `InProgress`, `Succeeded`, or `Failed`.
+
//here add the status Succeeded?

. Check that the {prod-short} instance has been recovered.

. Delete the `CheClusterRestore` object.
