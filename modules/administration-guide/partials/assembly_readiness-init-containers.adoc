{prod-short} Operator installs {prod-short} and starts its containers in the correct order. If a node with {prod-short} is restarted and all {prod-short} containers start simultaneously, some containers may fail because some other component they depend on is not ready. To avoid such failures, the readiness init containers queue the containers for {prod-short} components to start in the correct order.

The readiness init containers are disabled by default. If you choose to enable them, proceed according to the installation method used to install {prod-short}:
