IMPORTANT: The {prod-short} Operator automatically backs up the {prod-short} instance before every {prod-short} update, permitting rollback to previous {prod-short} version if needed. If you configure only one backup server, that backup server is automatically used for pre-update backups by default. If you configure multiple backup servers, you must add the `che.eclipse.org/backup-before-update: true` annotation to the custom object of only one of them to specify it as the default backup server for pre-update backups. (If you don't add this annotation for one of multiple backup servers, or if you add this annotation for multiple backup servers, then the {prod-short} Operator defaults to using the internal backup server for pre-update backups.)
