= Creating a backup using the internal backup server

To use the internal backup server, you must request automatic configuration from {prod-short} Operator as follows:

include::warning_does-not-back-up-content-of-workspaces.adoc[]

NOTE: Configuring a backup server inside the same cluster, as described in this procedure, is not recommended for a production environment. See the recommended procedure: xref:managing-backups-using-custom-resources.adoc#creating-a-backup-using-an-object_{context}[Creating a new backup using an object].
