= Selecting an Open VSX registry instance

include::example$snip_{project-context}-default-vsx-registry.adoc[]

If the default Open VSX registry instance does not meet your requirements, you can select one of the following instances:

include::example$snip_{project-context}-non-default-vsx-registry-instance.adoc[]

* A standalone Open VSX registry instance that is deployed on a network accessible from {prod-short} workspace pods.

.Prerequisites

* You have administrator access to the cluster where {prod-short} is deployed.
* You have the `oc` CLI tool installed if you are using the command line.

.Procedure

. Log on to the cluster as an administrator.
. Edit the `CheCluster` custom resource to update the `openVSXURL` value:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spec:
  components:
    pluginRegistry:
      openVSXURL: "__<url_of_an_open_vsx_registry_instance>__" # <1>
----
<1> For example: `openVSXURL: "pass:c,a,q[https://open-vsx.org]"`.

.Save the changes to the custom resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Do not use link:https://open-vsx.org[https://open-vsx.org] in an air-gapped environment or an environment that is isolated from the internet. To reduce the risk of malware infections and unauthorized access to your code, use the embedded or a self-hosted Open VSX registry with a curated set of extensions.

* To select the embedded Open VSX registry instance in the `plugin-registry` pod, use `openVSXURL: ''`. You can customize the list of included extensions xref:adding-or-removing-extensions-in-a-workspace_{context}[using a workspace] or xref:adding-or-removing-extensions-on-linux_{context}[using a Linux operating system].

* You can point `openVSXURL` to the URL of a standalone Open VSX registry instance if the URL is accessible from within the organization's cluster and not blocked by a proxy. 
====

.Verification

. Confirm that the `plugin-registry` pod has restarted.
. Open a workspace and verify that extensions are available from the selected registry instance in the *Extensions* view.
