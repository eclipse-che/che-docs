= Selecting an Open VSX registry instance

The Open VSX registry at `pass:c,a,q[https://open-vsx.org]` is the default if resolved from within your organization's cluster. If not, then the embedded Open VSX registry within the {prod-short} `plugin-registry` pod is the default.

If the default Open VSX registry instance is not what you need, you can select another Open VSX registry instance as follows.

.Procedure

* Edit the `openVSXURL` value in the `CheCluster` custom resource:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spec:
  components:
    pluginRegistry:
      openVSXURL: "__<url_of_an_open_vsx_registry_instance>__"
----
+
[TIP]
====
* The default `openVSXURL` value is `pass:c,a,q[https://open-vsx.org]`.
 
* To select the embedded Open VSX registry instance in the `plugin-registry` pod, use `openVSXURL: ''`. You can xref:adding-or-removing-extensions-in-the-embedded-open-vsx-registry-instance[customize the list of included extensions].

* You can also point `openVSXURL` at the URL of a standalone Open VSX registry instance if its URL is accessible from within your organization's cluster and not blocked by a proxy.
