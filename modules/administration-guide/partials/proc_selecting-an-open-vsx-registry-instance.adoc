====
* Using link:https://open-vsx.org[https://open-vsx.org] is not recommended in an air-gapped environment, isolated from the internet. In order to reduce the risk of malware infections and unauthorized access to your code use the embedded or self-hosted Open VSX registry with the curated set of extensions.

* To select the embedded Open VSX registry instance in the `plugin-registry` pod, use `openVSXURL: ''`. You can xref:adding-or-removing-extensions-in-the-embedded-open-vsx-registry-instance[customize the list of included extensions].

* You can also point `openVSXURL` at the URL of a standalone Open VSX registry instance if its URL is accessible from within your organization's cluster and not blocked by a proxy.
