= Purpose of readiness init containers

{prod-short} Operator installs {prod-short} and starts its containers in the right order. Yet if a node with {prod-short} is restarted and all {prod-short} containers start simultaneously, some containers may fail because some other component they depend on is not ready. To avoid such failures, readiness init containers queue the containers for {prod-short} components to start in the right order.
