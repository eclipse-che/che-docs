= Purpose of readiness init containers

{prod-short} Operator installs {prod-short} and starts its containers in the right order. Yet if a node with {prod-short} is restarted and all {prod-short} containers start simultaneously, some containers may fail because some other component they depend on is not ready.

To avoid such failures, readiness init containers queue the containers for {prod-short} components to start in the right order.

Readiness init containers are not enabled by default, so to use them you first have to enable them according to the installation method used to install {prod-short} (Operator installer or OLM installer).
