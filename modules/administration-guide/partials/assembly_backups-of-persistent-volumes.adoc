= Backups of persistent volumes

Persistent Volumes (PVs) store workspace data for {prod-short} similarly to how workspace data are stored for desktop IDEs on a local hard disk drive. PVs must be backed up periodically to prevent data loss. Storage-agnostic tools are available for backing up and restoring {platforms-name} resources, including PVs.
