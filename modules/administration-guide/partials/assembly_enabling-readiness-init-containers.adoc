= Enabling readiness init containers

:context: assembly_enabling-startup-init-containers

Normally, {prod-short} Operator installs {prod} and starts its containers in the right order.
However, if a node with {prod-short} gets restarted, than all {prod-short} containers start simultaneously and some might fail as dependent component might not be ready yet.
To handle such a case, one should enable readiness init containers for {prod-short} components.

Choose the procedure depending on installer type:
