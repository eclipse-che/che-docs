include::warning_does-not-back-up-content-of-workspaces.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* xref:backup-server-setup.adoc[Backup server setup]

* xref:managing-backups-of-prod-short-instances-using-prod-cli.adoc#configuring-prod-cli-to-use-a-backup-server_{context}[Configuring {prod-cli} to use a backup server]

.Procedure

* Use the following command to create a backup and send it to the pre-configured backup server:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {prod-cli} server:backup --repository-url=__<repository-url>__  --repository-password=__<repository-password>__
----

NOTE: It is possible to create other backups to the same backup server using the `server:backup` command with no arguments.

NOTE: After running the `server:backup` command with no arguments for the first time on installation of {prod-short}, an internal backup server is configured and used.
