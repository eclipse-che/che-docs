= Defining the list of images to pull

The {image-puller-name-short} can pre-pull most images, including scratch images such as `che-machine-exec`. However, images that mount volumes in the Dockerfile, such as `traefik`, are not supported for pre-pulling on OpenShift 3.11.

Pre-pulling images involved in workspace startup will reduce workspace start times. For example:

* Che-Theia
* broker images
* plug-in sidecar images

.Prerequisites

* The `curl` tool is available. See link:https://curl.se/[curl homepage].
* The `jq` tool is available. See link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq homepage].
* The `yq` tool is available. See link:https://pypi.org/project/yq/[yq homepage].

.Procedure

. Gather a list of relevant container images for the {platforms-name} platform:
+
include::example$snip_{project-context}-getting-the-list-of-relevant-images.adoc[]


. Determine images from the list for pre-pulling. 
+
For faster workspace startup times, consider pre-pulling the workspace-related images:
