= {prod-short} workspaces architecture

A {prod-short} deployment on the cluster consists of the {prod-short} server component, a database for storing user profile and preferences, and several additional deployments hosting workspaces. The {prod-short} server orchestrates the creation of workspaces, which consist of a deployment containing the workspace containers and enabled plug-ins, plus related components, such as:

* ConfigMaps
* services
* endpoints
* ingresses/routes
* secrets
* PVs

The {prod-short} workspace is a web application. It is composed of microservices running in containers that provide all the services of a modern IDE such as an editor, language auto-completion, and debugging tools. The IDE services are deployed with the development tools, packaged in containers and user runtime applications, which are defined as {orch-name} resources.

The source code of the projects of a {prod-short} workspace is persisted in a {platforms-name} `PersistentVolume`. Microservices run in containers that have read-write access to the source code (IDE services, development tools), and runtime applications have read-write access to this shared directory.

The following diagram shows the detailed components of a {prod-short} workspace.

In the diagram, there are four running workspaces: two belonging to *User A*, one to *User B* and one to *User C*.

Use the devfile format to specify the tools and runtime applications of a {prod-short} workspace.
