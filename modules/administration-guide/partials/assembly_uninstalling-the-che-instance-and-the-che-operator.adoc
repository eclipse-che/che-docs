= Uninstalling the {prod-short} instance and the {prod} Operator

After uninstalling the {devworkspace} Operator, uninstall the {prod-short} instance and the {prod} Operator.

.Prerequisites

* OperatorHub was used to install the {prod-short} instance on {ocp} or {osd}.

* An active `oc` session with administrative permissions to the OpenShift cluster hosting the {prod-short} instance to uninstall. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp4-ver}/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI].

.Procedure


. Switch to the namespace where the {prod-short} instance is deployed:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ oc project __<{prod-id-short}_namespace>__
----

. Obtain the `CheCluster` `NAME`:

+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ oc get checluster
----

. Delete the {prod-short} cluster:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ oc delete checluster __<checluster_name>__
----

. Obtain the `NAME` of the {prod-short} cluster service version (CSV):
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ oc get csv
----

. Delete the {prod-short} CSV:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ oc delete csv __<csv_name>__
----
+
This uninstalls the {prod} Operator.
