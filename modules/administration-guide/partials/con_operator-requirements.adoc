= {prod-short} Operator requirements

The {prod-short} Operator manages six operands running in six distinct pods. The following table presents the default resource requirements of each of these operands.

|===

The {prod-short} Operator, which powers all the operands, consists of a single container with the `64Mi` memory request and `256Mi` limit. These default values are sufficient when the {prod-short} Operator manages a relatively big amount of {prod-short} workspaces. For even larger deployments, consider increasing the defaults.
