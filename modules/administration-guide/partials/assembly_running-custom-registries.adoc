.Prerequisites

The `my-plug-in-registry` and `my-devfile-registry` images used in this section are built using the `docker` command. This section assumes that these images are available on the {platforms-name} cluster where {prod-short} is deployed.

ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
This is true on Minikube, for example, if before running the `docker build` commands, the user executed:

* The `eval ${minikube docker-env}` command for Minikube.
endif::[]

These images can be then pushed to:

* A public container registry such as `quay.io`, or the DockerHub.
* A private registry.
