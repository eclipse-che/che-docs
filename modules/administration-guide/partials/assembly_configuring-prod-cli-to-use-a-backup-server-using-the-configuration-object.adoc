= Configuring {prod-cli} to use a backup server using the configuration object

You can configure {prod-cli} to use a backup server by pointing {prod-cli} to the backup server configuration object using a command argument or an environment variable.

////
example: `chectl server:backup --backup-server-config-name=backup-cr-name`
However, the command above is not just a configuration, it is action to create a backup. It configures chectl, but it also creates a backup.
