= Gateway

The {prod-short} gateway has three main roles:

* Routing requests. It uses link:https://github.com/traefik/traefik[Traefik].

* Ensuring authentication with OpenID Connect (OIDC). It uses {link-oauth2-proxy}.

* Applying {orch-name} Role based access control (RBAC) policies to control access to any {prod-short} resource. It uses {link-kube-rbac-proxy}.

{link-oidc-issuer} is the default OIDC issuer. The {prod-short} operator deploys it with preconfigured static users. It can serve as a bridge to third party {identity-provider}, such as GitHub.

The {prod-short} operator manages it as the `che-gateway` Deployment.

It controls access to:
