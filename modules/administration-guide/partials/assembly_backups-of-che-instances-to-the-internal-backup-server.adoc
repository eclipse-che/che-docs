In a non-production environment, the optional internal backup server can be used to create backups for testing purposes. The internal backup server is a REST backup server that is managed by {prod-short} Operator.

NOTE: {prod-short} Operator defaults to using the internal backup server if {prod-short} is configured to use multiple external backup servers without any annotation.

IMPORTANT: {prod-short} Operator defaults to using the internal backup server for pre-update backups (to permit {prod-short} version rollback) if multiple backup servers are configured and if the `che.eclipse.org/backup-before-update: true` annotation is either not added to the custom object of any one of the multiple backup servers or the annotation is added to more than one of the multiple backup servers.
