= Backing up a {prod-short} instance to a REST backup server by custom resources

To back up a {prod-short} instance to an external REST backup server by custom resources:

* You first create a custom object to configure {prod-short} to use a REST backup server.

* You then create a custom object to take a backup snapshot of a {prod-short} instance and send the snapshot to the configured REST backup server.
