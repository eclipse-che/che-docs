= Configuring {prod-short} to use a backup server


To configure a backup server for {prod-short}, a user needs to create the `CheBackupServerConfiguration` Custom Resource object in the {prod-namespace} namespace. The object's `spec` property is divided in several sections where each corresponds to a specific xref:setup-backup-server.adoc[backup server type]:

 * xref:configuring-rest-server-cr[REST]
 * xref:configuring-aws-s3-or-api-compatible-server-cr[AWS S3 or API compatible]
 * xref:configuring-sftp-server-cr[SFTP]
+
[NOTE]
====
* The Custom Resource object, stored in the `{prod-namespace}` namespace, must have only one section configured in the `spec` property.

* It is possible to configure as many backup servers as needed, but each in a separate `Custom Resource`.

* Referenced secrets for each server type must exist and have required fields specified. See the description of each secret in the corresponding server-type chapters.
