:context: authorizing-users

User authorization in {prod-short} is based on the permissions model. Permissions are used to control the allowed actions of users and establish a security model. Every request is verified for the presence of the required permission in the current user subject after it passes authentication. You can control resources managed by {prod-short} and allow certain actions by assigning permissions to users.

Permissions can be applied to the following entities:

* Workspace
* System

All permissions can be managed using the provided REST API. The APIs are documented using Swagger at `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/swagger/#!/permissions]`.
