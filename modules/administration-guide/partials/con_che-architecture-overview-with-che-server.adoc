= {prod-short} architecture with the {prod-id-short}-server

Although {prod} is transitioning to xref:administration-guide:che-architecture-overview-with-dw.adoc[an architecture based on the DevWorksapce Operator], the default architecture is still based on the {prod-id-short}-server. The {prod-id-short}-server is a Java web service that exposes an HTTP REST API to manage {prod-short} workspaces and users. When {prod} is configured to use the {prod-id-short}-server its components are:

* A central workspace controller: an always-running service that manages user workspaces through the {orch-name} API.
* User workspaces: container-based IDEs that the controller stops when the user stops coding.

.High-level {prod-short} architecture

When {prod-short} is installed on a {platforms-name} cluster, the workspace controller is the only component that is deployed. A {prod-short} workspace is created immediately after a user requests it.
