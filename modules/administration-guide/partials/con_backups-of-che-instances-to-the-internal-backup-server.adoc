= Backups of {prod-short} instances to the internal backup server

In a non-production environment, the optional xref:configuring-che-to-use-the-internal-backup-server_{context}[internal backup server] can be used to create backups for testing purposes. The internal backup server is a REST backup server that is managed by {prod-short} Operator.

NOTE: {prod-short} Operator defaults to using the internal backup server if {prod-short} is configured to use multiple external backup servers without any annotation.
