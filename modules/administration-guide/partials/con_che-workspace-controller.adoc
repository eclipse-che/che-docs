= {prod-short} workspace controller

The workspaces controller manages the container-based development environments: {prod-short} workspaces. To secure the development environements with authentication, the deployment is always multiuser and multitenant.


* *Multiuser*: This is a multitenant configuration. Development environments are secured. Appropriate for cloud installations.

The following diagram  shows the different services that are a part of the {prod-short} workspaces controller. Note that {identity-provider} and PostgreSQL are only needed in the multiuser configuration.
