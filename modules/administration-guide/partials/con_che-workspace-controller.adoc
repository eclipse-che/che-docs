= {prod-short} workspace controller

The workspaces controller manages the container-based development environments: {prod-short} workspaces. Following deployment scenarios are available:

* *Single-user*: The deployment contains no authentication service. Development environments are not secured. This configuration requires fewer resources. It is more adapted for local installations.

* *Multiuser*: This is a multitenant configuration. Development environments are secured, and this configuration requires more resources. Appropriate for cloud installations.

The following diagram  shows the different services that are a part of the {prod-short} workspaces controller. Note that {identity-provider} and PostgreSQL are only needed in the multiuser configuration.
