= Backup and recovery

Backing up {prod-short} involves a combination of the following processes that back up different data:

* Use {prod-short} Operator and a xref:supported-restic-compatible-backup-servers.adoc[configured backup server] to back up and restore the {prod-short} instance. You can back up the {prod-short} instance by using custom resources or {prod-cli} to a backup server that you have configured: xref:backing-up-of-che-instances-to-an-sftp-backup-server.adoc[SFTP], xref:backing-up-of-che-instances-to-amazon-s3.adoc[Amazon S3] (or S3 API compatible storage), or xref:backing-up-of-che-instances-to-a-rest-backup-server.adoc[REST]. You can restore the {prod-short} instance using xref:restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup.adoc#restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup-by-using-the-checlusterrestore-object_{context}[custom resources] or xref:restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup.adoc#restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup-by-using-prod-cli_{context}[{prod-cli}].
+
NOTE: Use the xref:backing-up-of-che-instances-to-the-internal-backup-server.adoc[internal backup server] to test this process.

* Use xref:backing-up-of-persistent-volumes.adoc[backups of persistent volumes] to back up and restore the source code stored in users' workspaces.
+
TIP: Whether or not you implement backups of persistent volumes, advise users to commit and push their changes to avoid losing their work.

* Use xref:backing-up-of-postgresql.adoc[backups of the PostgreSQL database] to back up and restore persisting data about the state of {prod-short}.
