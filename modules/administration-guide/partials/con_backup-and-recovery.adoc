Backing up {prod-short} involves a combination of the following processes that back up respective data:

* Backing up and restoring the {prod-short} instance by using {prod-short} Operator and a xref:supported-restic-compatible-backup-servers.adoc[configured backup server]. You can back up the {prod-short} instance using custom resources or {prod-cli} to an external backup server that you have configured: xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-a-rest-backup-server.adoc[REST], xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-an-sftp-backup-server.adoc[SFTP], or xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-amazon-s3.adoc[Amazon S3]. You can restore the {prod-short} instance using xref:restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup.adoc#restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup-using-the-checlusterrestore-object_{context}[custom resources] or xref:restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup.adoc#restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup-using-prod-cli_{context}[{prod-cli}]. For testing this process in a non-production environment, {prod-short} offers the xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-the-internal-backup-server.adoc[internal backup server].

* Backing up and restoring persisting data about the state of {prod-short} by using xref:backups-of-external-postgresql.adoc[backups of an external PostgreSQL database].

* Backing up and restoring the content of users' workspaces by using xref:backups-of-persistent-volumes.adoc[backups of persistent volumes].
