= Backup and recovery

Backing up {prod-short} involves a combination of the following processes that back up respective data:

* Backing up and restoring the {prod-short} instance by using {prod-short} Operator and a xref:supported-restic-compatible-backup-servers.adoc[configured backup server]. You can back up the {prod-short} instance using custom resources or {prod-cli} to an external backup server that you have configured: xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-an-sftp-backup-server.adoc[SFTP], xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-amazon-s3.adoc[Amazon S3] (or S3 API compatible storage), or xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-a-rest-backup-server.adoc[REST]. You can restore the {prod-short} instance using xref:restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup.adoc#restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup-using-the-checlusterrestore-object_{context}[custom resources] or xref:restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup.adoc#restoring-a-che-instance-from-a-backup-using-prod-cli_{context}[{prod-cli}].
+
NOTE: For testing this process, {prod-short} offers the xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-the-internal-backup-server.adoc[internal backup server].

* Backing up and restoring the source code stored in users' workspaces by using xref:backups-of-persistent-volumes.adoc[backups of persistent volumes].
+
TIP: Whether or not backups of persistent volumes are implemented, users can be advised to commit and push their changes to avoid losing their work.

* Backing up and restoring persisting data about the state of {prod-short} by using xref:backups-of-postgresql.adoc[backups of the PostgreSQL database].
