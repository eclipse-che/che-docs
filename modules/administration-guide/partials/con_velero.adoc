== Velero

The recommended, open-source tool for backing up {orch-name} applications and their PVs is Velero. It can perform the following operations:

* Deploy in the cloud or on premises.
* Back up the cluster and restore backed up data in case of data loss.
* Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.
* Replicate a production cluster to development and testing clusters.

NOTE: Alternatively, you can use backup solutions that depend on the underlying storage system: for example, solutions specific to Gluster or Ceph.
