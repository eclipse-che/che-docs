This document covers all aspects of user authentication in {prod}, both on the {prod-short} server and in workspaces. This includes securing all REST API endpoints, WebSocket or JSON RPC connections, and some web resources.

All authentication types use the link:https://jwt.io/introduction/[JWT open standard] as a container for transferring user identity information. In addition, {prod-short} server authentication is based on the link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] protocol implementation, which is provided by default by {identity-provider-url}[{identity-provider}].

Authentication in workspaces implies the issuance of self-signed per-workspace JWT tokens and their verification on a dedicated service based on link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-jwtproxy/[JWTProxy].
