= Devfile registries

The {prod-short} devfile registries are services providing a list of {prod-short} samples to create ready-to-use workspaces.
The list is visible on the *Dashboard* -> *Create Workspace* page.
A Devfile v2.1 describes each sample.
A devfile registry runs in a container. 
The {prod-short} deployment starts one plug-in registry instance in the `plugin-registry` Deployment. 

The following services are reading the content of the registry:

* xref:user-dashboard.adoc[]
* xref:che-server.adoc[]
