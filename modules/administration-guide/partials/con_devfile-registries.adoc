= Devfile registries

The {prod-short} devfile registries are services providing a list of {prod-short} samples to create ready-to-use workspaces.
The list is visible on the *Dashboard* -> *Create Workspace* page.
A Devfile v2 describes each sample.
A devfile registry runs in a container. 
The {prod-short} deployment starts one devfile registry instance in the `devfile-registry` Deployment. 

The following services are reading the content of the registry:
