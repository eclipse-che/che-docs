= Configuring log levels

The format of the value of the `CHE_LOGGER_CONFIG` property is a list of comma separated key-value pairs, where keys are the names of the loggers as seen
in the {prod-short} server log output and values are the required log levels.

In Operator-based deployments, the `CHE_LOGGER_CONFIG` variable is specified under the `customCheProperties` of the custom resource.

For example, the following snippet would make the `WorkspaceManager` produce the `DEBUG` log messages.

[source,yaml]
----
...
server:
  customCheProperties:
    CHE_LOGGER_CONFIG: "org.eclipse.che.api.workspace.server.WorkspaceManager=DEBUG"
