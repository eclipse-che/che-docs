{prod} uses {identity-provider-url}[{identity-provider}] to create, import, manage, delete, and authenticate users. {identity-provider} uses built-in authentication mechanisms and user storage. It can use third-party identity management systems to create and authenticate users. {prod} requires a {identity-provider} token when you request access to {prod-short} resources.

Local users and imported federation users must have an email address in their profile.
