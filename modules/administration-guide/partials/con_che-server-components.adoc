.{prod-short} server components interacting with the {devworkspace} operator
image::architecture/{project-context}-deployments-interacting-with-devworkspace.png[]

The {prod-short} server components ensure multi-tenancy and workspaces management.

// The following 2 notes should be commented out until workspaces authentication is supported:

// NOTE: When {prod-short} uses the {devworkspace} operator, {identity-provider} is not a requirement anymore. On vanilla Kubernetes, {prod-short} can be configured to use any OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider (the default is https://dexidp.io/[Dex]). On OpenShift, {prod-short} uses the available OpenShift OAuth v2 service.
