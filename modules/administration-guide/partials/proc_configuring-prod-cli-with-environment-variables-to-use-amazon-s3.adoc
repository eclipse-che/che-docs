= Configuring {prod-cli} with environment variables to use Amazon S3

As an alternative to using command-line options for `{prod-cli} server:backup`, you can configure {prod-cli} for Amazon S3 with environment variables. This enables you to run `{prod-cli} server:backup` without having to enter those options with it.

.Prerequisites

* Installed `{prod-cli}`.
* Configured Amazon S3. See xref:supported-restic-compatible-backup-servers.adoc[].

.Procedure

Which environment variables you need to set depends on your use case:

* If you do not have a `CheBackupServerConfiguration` custom object yet, then you can set the following environment variables:
** `BACKUP_REPOSITORY_URL` for the backup repository.
** `BACKUP_REPOSITORY_PASSWORD` for the backup repository password.
** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` for the user’s AWS access key ID.
** `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for the user’s AWS secret access key.

* If you already have a `CheBackupServerConfiguration` custom object, you can set the following environment variable that will point {prod-cli} to that `CheBackupServerConfiguration` custom object:
** `BACKUP_SERVER_CONFIG_NAME` for the `name` of a `CheBackupServerConfiguration` custom object to point {prod-cli} to. (You can find `name` under `metadata` in the custom object.)
