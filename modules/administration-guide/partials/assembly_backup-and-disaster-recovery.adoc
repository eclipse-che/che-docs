{prod} Operator can create backups of {prod-short} instances and restore them from a backup snapshot if needed. The following chapter describes ways of preparing such backups and their use in the follow-up recovery phase:

* xref:managing-backups-using-cli.adoc[]
* xref:managing-backups-using-custom-resources.adoc[]


[CAUTION]
====
* The standard backup mechanism of {prod-short} does not back up the content of users' workspaces. To preserve local changes, see xref:persistent-volumes-backups.adoc[].

* Backup snapshots are bound to their own specific cluster and must be used only there.
