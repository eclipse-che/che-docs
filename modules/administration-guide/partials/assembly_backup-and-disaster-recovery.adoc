{prod-short} Operator can create backups of {prod-short} instances and restore them from a backup snapshot if needed. The following chapter describes ways of preparing such backups and their use in the follow-up recovery phase:

* xref:managing-backups-using-cli.adoc[]
* xref:managing-backups-using-custom-resources.adoc[]


[CAUTION]
====
* The standard backup mechanism of {prod-short} does not back up the content of users' workspaces. To preserve local changes, see xref:persistent-volumes-backups.adoc[].

* Backup snapshots are bound to their own specific cluster and must be used only there.
====

* {prod-short} Operator creates a new backup on every {prod-short} update.
* xref:define-backup-server-for-operator.adoc[Configured] backup server is automatically used to store the backup.
* When a {prod-short} administrator configures more than one backup server, the {prod-short} Operator uses the server with the `che.eclipse.org/backup-before-update: true` annotation by default.
* {prod-short} Operator uses the internal backup server:
** Every time the {prod-short} administrator does not configure the backup server.
** When several backup servers do not have any annotation.
