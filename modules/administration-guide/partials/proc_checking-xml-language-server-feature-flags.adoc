= Checking XML language server feature flags

.Procedure

. Check if the features are enabled. The XML plug-in provides multiple settings that can enable and disable features:
+
* `xml.format.enabled`: Enable the formatter
* `xml.validation.enabled`: Enable the validation
* `xml.documentSymbols.enabled`: Enable the document symbols

. To diagnose whether the XML language server is working, create a simple XML element, such as `<hello></hello>`, and confirm that it appears in the *Outline* panel on the right.

. If the document symbols do not show, ensure that the `xml.documentSymbols.enabled` attribute is set to `true`. If it is `true`, and there are no symbols, the language server may not be hooked to the editor. If there are document symbols, then the language server is connected to the editor.

. Ensure that the features that the user needs, are set to `true` in the settings (they are set to `true` by default). If any of the features are not working, or not working as expected, file an issue against the
