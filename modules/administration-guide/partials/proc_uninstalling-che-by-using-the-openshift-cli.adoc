=== Uninstalling {prod-short} by using the OpenShift CLI

To uninstall the {prod-short} instance and the {prod} Operator by using the OpenShift CLI:

.Prerequisites

* OperatorHub was used to install the {prod-short} instance on {ocp} or {osd}.
* You have access to the OpenShift web console of your organization's {prod-short} instance.
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed in the operating system you are using. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli[Installing the OpenShift CLI].

.Procedure

. Sign in to the cluster.

+
`$ oc login -u __<username>__ -p __<password>__ __<cluster_url>__`

. Switch to the namespace where the {prod-short} instance is deployed:

+
`$ oc project __<{prod-id-short}_namespace>__`

. Obtain the `CheCluster` `NAME`:

+
`$ oc get checluster`

. Delete the {prod-short} cluster:

+
`$ oc delete checluster __<checluster_name>__`

. Obtain the `NAME` of the {prod-short} cluster service version (CSV):

+
`$ oc get csv`

. Delete the {prod-short} CSV:

+
`$ oc delete csv __<csv_name>__`

+
This uninstalls the {prod} Operator.
