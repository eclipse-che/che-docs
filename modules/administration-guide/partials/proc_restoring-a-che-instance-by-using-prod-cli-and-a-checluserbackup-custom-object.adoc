= Restoring a {prod-short} instance by using {prod-cli} and a CheClusterBackup custom object

You can restore a {prod-short} instance by entering the name of the `CheClusterBackup` custom object as an argument with the `{prod-cli} server:restore` command.

IMPORTANT: If the backup snapshot was taken in an earlier version of Che, then `{prod-cli} server:restore --backup-cr-name=__<name_of_custom_object>__` rolls back Che to that earlier version, which is specified in the `CheClusterBackup` custom object.

.Prerequisites
* Installed `{prod-cli}`.
* The `CheClusterBackup` custom object that was used to create the backup snapshot.
* The backup snapshot that was taken using the `CheClusterBackup` custom object and stored on any of the following:
