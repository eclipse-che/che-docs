= Configure {prod-cli} to use backup server

The following section describes how to define environment variables for a specific backup server using the {prod-cli} tool.

.Procedure

. Determine xref:setup-backup-server.adoc[backup server type] and the server URL. Use the link:https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html[restic repository documentation] as the reference.
+
The URL can be specified with the `-r` parameter or defined using the `BACKUP_REPOSITORY_URL` environment variable.

. Retrieve or create a password for the backup repository.
+
The password can be specified with the `-p` parameter or defined using the `BACKUP_REPOSITORY_PASSWORD` environment variable.
+
[WARNING]
====
Backup data are encrypted with this password. The loss of the backup repository password will cause losing the data.
====

. Set the following environment variables for the chosen xref:setup-backup-server.adoc[backup server type]:

* `REST`
+
When optional authentication is turned on, export `REST_SERVER_USERNAME` and `REST_SERVER_PASSWORD` environment variables.

* `AWS S3`
+
Export `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables using the AWS user credentials.

* `SFTP`
+
For the login without a password, export the `SSH_KEY_FILE` environment variable that holds the path to a file with the corresponding SSH key or provide the `--ssh-key-file` parameter.
+
Alternatively, use the `SSH_KEY` environment variable that holds the SSH key itself.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to point directly to the backup server configuration object using `--backup-server-config-name` parameter or `BACKUP_SERVER_CONFIG_NAME` environment variable.
In such a case, all the configuration above is not needed. For more details, see xref:managing-backups-through-custom-resources.adoc[]
