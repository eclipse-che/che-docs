= Collecting {prod-short} Server metrics with Prometheus

To use Prometheus to collect, store, and query JVM metrics for {prod-short} Server:

.Prerequisites

* {prod-short} is exposing metrics on port `8087`. See xref:enabling-and-exposing-{prod-id-short}-metrics_{context}[Enabling and exposing {prod-short} server JVM metrics].

* Prometheus 2.26.0 or later is running. The Prometheus console is running on port `9090` with a corresponding Service. See link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[First steps with Prometheus].

.Procedure

. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from port `8087`.
+
NOTE: The xref:installing-prometheus-and-grafana.adoc[example monitoring stack] already creates the `prometheus-config` ConfigMap with an empty configuration. To provide the Prometheus configuration details, edit the `data` field of the ConfigMap.

.Prometheus configuration
====
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
data:
  prometheus.yml: |-
      global:
        scrape_interval:     5s             <1>
        evaluation_interval: 5s             <2>
      scrape_configs:                       <3>
        - job_name: 'Che Server'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['che-host.__<{prod-short}_{orch-namespace}>__:8087']  <4>
----
<1> The rate at which a target is scraped.
<2> The rate at which the recording and alerting rules are re-checked.
<3> The resources that Prometheus monitors. In the default configuration, a single job, `Che Server`, scrapes the time series data exposed by {prod-short} Server.
<4> The scrape target for the metrics from port `8087`. Replace `__<{prod-short}_{orch-namespace}>__` with the {prod-short} {orch-namespace}. The default {prod-short} {orch-namespace} is `{prod-namespace}`.
====

. Scale the `Prometheus` Deployment down and up to read the updated ConfigMap from the previous step.
+
[source,terminal,subs="+attributes,quotes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} scale --replicas=0 deployment/prometheus -n monitoring && {orch-cli} scale --replicas=1 deployment/prometheus -n monitoring
----

.Verification

. Use port forwarding to access the `Prometheus` Service locally:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+attributes,quotes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090 -n monitoring
----
. Verify that all targets are up by viewing the `targets` endpoint at `localhost:9090/targets`.
. Use the Prometheus console to view and query metrics:
** View metrics at `localhost:9090/metrics`.
** Query metrics from `localhost:9090/graph`.
