= Collecting {prod-short} metrics with Prometheus

To use Prometheus to collect, store, and query metrics about {prod-short}:

.Prerequisites

* {prod-short} is exposing metrics on port `8087`. See xref:enabling-and-exposing-{prod-id-short}-metrics_{context}[Enabling and exposing {prod-short} server JVM metrics].

* Prometheus  2.26.0 or later is running. The Prometheus console is running on port `9090` with a corresponding `service` and `route`. See link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[First steps with Prometheus].

.Procedure

* Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from port `8087`.

.Prometheus configuration
====
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
data:
  prometheus.yml: |-
      global:
        scrape_interval:     5s             <1>
        evaluation_interval: 5s             <2>
      scrape_configs:                       <3>  
        - job_name: 'che'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['[che-host]:8087']  <4>          
----
<1> The rate at which a target is scraped.
<2> The rate at which the recording and alerting rules are re-checked.
<3> The Resources that Prometheus monitors. In the default configuration, a single job, `che`, scrapes the time series data exposed by the {prod-short} server.
<4> The scrape metrics from port `8087`.

.Verification steps

. View the metrics in the Prometheus console at `http://__<prometheus-url>__/metrics`.

. Query the metrics in the Prometheus console from `http://__<prometheus-url>__/graph`. For more information, see link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/#using-the-expression-browser[Using the expression browser].

. Verify that all targets are up by viewing the targets endpoint at `http://__<prometheus-url>__/targets`.
