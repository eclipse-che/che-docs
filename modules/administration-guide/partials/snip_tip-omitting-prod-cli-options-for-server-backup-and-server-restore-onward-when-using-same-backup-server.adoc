TIP: Last used backup server information is stored in a secret inside the {prod-short} cluster. When consistently using the same backup server, you can enter the `--repository-url` and `--repository-password` options with the `{prod-cli} server:backup` command just once and omit them onward when entering `{prod-cli} server:backup` or `{prod-cli} server:restore`.
