= Manually selecting an Open VSX registry instance

If the default Open VSX registry instance is not what you need, you can select another Open VSX registry instance:

.Procedure

* Edit the `openVSXURL` value in the `CheCluster` custom resource:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spec:
  components:
    pluginRegistry:
      openVSXURL: "__<url_of_an_open_vsx_registry_instance>__"
----
+
[TIP]
====
* The default `openVSXURL` value is `pass:c,a,q[https://open-vsx.org]`.
 
* To select the embedded Open VSX registry instance in the `plugin-registry` pod, use `openVSXURL: ''`.

* You can point `openVSXURL` at the URL of your customized Open VSX registry. See the next section for how to configure and build it.
