= Backing up a {prod-short} instance to a REST backup server by using custom resources

:context: backing-up-a-{prod-id-short}-instance-to-a-rest-backup-server-by-using-custom-resources

Backing up a {prod-short} instance to a REST backup server by using custom resources requires two custom objects:

* First you create a custom object to configure {prod-short} to use a REST backup server.

* Then you create a custom object to make and send a backup snapshot of a {prod-short} instance to the configured REST backup server.
