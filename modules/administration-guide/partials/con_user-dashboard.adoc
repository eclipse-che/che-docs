image::architecture/{project-context}-user-dashboard-interactions.png[User dashboard interactions with other components]

To start a user workspace, the user dashboard:

. When the user starts a sample: collects the devfile from the devfile registries.
. When the user imports a Git repository: sends the repository URL to {prod-short} server and expects a devfile in return.
. Reads the devfile describing the workspace.
. Collects the additional metadata from the plug-in registries.
. Converts the information into a {devworkspace} Custom Resource.
. Creates the {devworkspace} Custom Resource in the user {orch-namespace}.
. Watches the {devworkspace} Custom Resource status.
. Redirects the user to the running workspace IDE.
