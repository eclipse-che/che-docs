= Enabling self-registration

Self-registration allows users to register themselves in a {prod-short} instance by accessing the {prod-short} server URL.

For {prod-short} installed without OpenShift OAuth support, self-registration is disabled by default, therefore the option to register a new user is not available on the login page.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in as an administrator.

.Procedure

To enable self-registration of users:

. Navigate to the *Realm Settings* menu on the left and open the *Login* tab.

. Set *User registration* option to *On*.
