= {prod-short} server components and the DevWorkspace Operator

The {prod-short} server components and the DevWorkspace Operator are the two central server-side components of {prod-short}. Together they manage {prod-short} container-based development environments (workspaces).

// The following 2 notes should be commented out until workspaces authentication is supported:

// NOTE: When {prod-short} uses the DevWorkspace Operator, it can only be configured in **multi-user** mode. Single user mode is not supported anymore.

// NOTE: When {prod-short} uses the DevWorkspace Operator, {identity-provider} is not a requirement anymore. On vanilla Kubernetes, {prod-short} can be configured to use any OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider (the default is https://dexidp.io/[Dex]). On OpenShift, {prod-short} uses the available OpenShift OAuth v2 service.

The following diagram shows the different server-side components of {prod-short}.
