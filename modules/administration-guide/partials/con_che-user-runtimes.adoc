[id="{prod-id-short}-user-runtimes_{context}"]
= {prod-short} user runtimes

Use any non-terminating user container as a user runtime. An application that can be defined as a container image or as a set of {platforms-name} resources can be included in a {prod-short} workspace. This makes it easy to test applications in the {prod-short} workspace.

To test an application in the {prod-short} workspace, include the application YAML definition used in stage or production in the workspace specification. It is a 12-factor application development / production parity.

Examples of user runtimes are Node.js, SpringBoot or MongoDB, and MySQL.
