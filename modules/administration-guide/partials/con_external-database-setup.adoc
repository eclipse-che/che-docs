The PostgreSQL database is used by the {prod-short} server for persisting data about the state of {prod-short}. It contains information about user accounts, workspaces, preferences, and other details.

By default, the {prod-short} Operator creates and manages the database deployment.

However, the {prod-short} Operator does not support full life-cycle capabilities, such as backups and recovery.

For a business-critical setup, configure an external database with the following recommended disaster-recovery options:

* High Availability (HA)
* Point In Time Recovery (PITR)

Configure an external PostgreSQL instance on-premises or use a cloud service, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). With Amazon RDS, it is possible to deploy production databases in a Multi-Availability Zone configuration for a resilient disaster recovery strategy with daily and on-demand snapshots.

The recommended configuration of the example database is:

[options="header"]
|===
|Parameter | Value
|Instance class | db.t2.small
|vCPU | 1
|RAM | 2 GB
|Multi-az | true, 2 replicas
|Engine version | 9.6.11
|TLS | enabled
|Automated backups | enabled (30 days)
