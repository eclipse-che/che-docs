adding-prod-url-to-git-repository-readme.adoc

////
note from Max: this applies only to org repositories, which means users who have their own (GH/GL) forks already won't use it, but we need to investigate the git process for cloning a repository and its UX impact of starting a workspace with a cloned project repo and then forking it and setting up a remote (GH/GL) origin of the user.

//ADD THE PROCEDURE TO ADD THE URL IN THE REPOSITORY
//THE URL MUST BE AVAILABLE IN README
//ADVANTAGES: THE URL IS AVAILABLE TO ALL USERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THE REPOSITORY AND CAN BE UPDATED ANY TIME WITH PROPAGATION OF THE NEW URL TO ALL FORKS THROUGH FETCHING AND MERGING THE FORKS
//  (this includes having the badge or not)
