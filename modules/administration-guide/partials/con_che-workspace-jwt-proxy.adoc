[id="{prod-id-short}-workspace-jwt-proxy_{context}"]
= {prod-short} workspace JWT proxy

The JWT proxy is responsible for securing the communication of the {prod-short} workspace services. The {prod-short} workspace JWT proxy is included in a {prod-short} workspace only if the {prod-short} server is configured in multi-user mode.

An HTTP proxy is used to sign outgoing requests from a workspace service to the {prod-short} server and to authenticate incoming requests from the IDE client running on a browser.
