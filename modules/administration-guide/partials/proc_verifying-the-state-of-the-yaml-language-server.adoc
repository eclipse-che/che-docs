= Verifying the state of the YAML language server

This section describes how to verify the state of the YAML language server.

.Procedure

Check if the container running the YAML plug-in is running the YAML language server.

. In the editor, open a terminal in the container that is running the YAML plug-in (an example name of the container: `vscode-yaml-__<xxx>__`).

. In the terminal, run the `ps aux | grep node` command. This command searches all the node processes running in the current container.

. Verify that a command `node ********/server.js` is running.

The `node ********/server.js` running in the container indicates that the language server is running. If it is not running, the language server has not started inside the container. In this case, see link:#checking-important-logs_viewing-logs-from-language-servers-and-debug-adapters[Checking important logs].
