= Supported Restic-compatible backup servers

{prod-short} uses {prod-short} Operator and integrated Restic for backing up and restoring {prod-short} instances from backup snapshots on a configured external backup server. {prod-short} Operator automates the creation of a Restic backup repository on the external backup server. To back up, {prod-short} Operator gathers the data needed for a backup snapshot and uses the integrated Restic to create and manage the snapshot. To restore, {prod-short} Operator uses the integrated Restic to retrieve and decrypt the snapshot, and then {prod-short} Operator applies the retrieved data to perform the recovery.

{prod-short} can use the following backup servers that are compatible with the integrated Restic:

SFTP:: See the documentation for the SFTP server solution you plan to use (link:https://www.openssh.com/[OpenSSH] or a derived commercial product) and link:https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#sftp[Restic Docs on SFTP].

Amazon S3:: See the documentation for link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html[Amazon S3] (or the chosen S3 API compatible storage) and link:https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#amazon-s3[Restic docs on Amazon S3].

REST:: See the README for link:https://github.com/restic/rest-server[Rest Server] and link:https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server[Restic docs on Rest Server].

For testing the backing up and restoring of {prod-short} instances, {prod-short} offers the xref:backups-of-che-instances-to-the-internal-backup-server.adoc[internal backup server].
