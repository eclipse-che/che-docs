= Disabling the readiness init containers for the Operator installer

To disable the previously enabled readiness init containers for {prod-short} installed by the Operator installer:

.Prerequisites

* {prod} installed by the Operator installer.

.Procedure

. Find {prod-short} Operator Deployment name.

. Edit the Deployment as follows: Under `spec.template.spec.containers[0].env` of the Operator Deployment, remove the following lines with the `ADD_COMPONENT_READINESS_INIT_CONTAINERS` environment variable:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
 - name: ADD_COMPONENT_READINESS_INIT_CONTAINERS
   value: "true"
----

. Wait while {prod-short} Operator restarts some components.

NOTE: Repeat these steps after each {prod-short} upgrade when a new Operator Deployment is created.
