= Understanding {prod-short} server advanced configuration

The following section describes the {prod-short} server component advanced configuration method for a deployment.

Advanced configuration is necessary to:

* Add environment variables not automatically generated by the Operator from the standard `CheCluster` Custom Resource fields.
* Override the properties automatically generated by the Operator from the standard `CheCluster` Custom Resource fields.


The `customCheProperties` field, part of the `CheCluster` Custom Resource `server` settings, contains a
map of additional environment variables to apply to the {prod-short} server component.

[NOTE]
====
Previous versions of the {prod-short} Operator had a ConfigMap named `custom` to fulfill this role. If the {prod-short} Operator finds a `configMap` with the name `custom`, it adds the data it contains into the `customCheProperties` field, redeploys {prod-short}, and deletes the `custom` `configMap`.
