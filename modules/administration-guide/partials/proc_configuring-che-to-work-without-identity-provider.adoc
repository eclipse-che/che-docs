[id="configuring-prod-short-to-work-without-identity-provider_{context}"]
= Configuring {prod-short} to work without {identity-provider}

By default, {prod-short} is deployed in multiuser mode where {identity-provider} and PostgreSQL are enabled. However, it is possible to deploy it in the single-user mode too, by changing the `CHE_MULTIUSER` value to `false`. In that case, neither {identity-provider} nor PostgreSQL are installed.


.Prerequisites

*  The `{prod-cli}` management tool is available. See the xref:overview:using-the-chectl-management-tool.adoc[] section. Alternatively, the OpenShift command line tool, `oc`, can be used.

.Procedure

. Prepare the `cr-patch.yaml` file with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  server:
      customCheProperties:
        CHE_MULTIUSER: false
----

. Install {prod-short} in the single-user mode:
+
[subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {prod-cli} server:deploy --platform __<platform>__ --installer operator  --che-operator-cr-patch-yaml cr-patch.yaml
----
+
Depending on the strategy used, replace the `_<platform>_` option in the above example with `crc`, `minishift`, or `openshift`.
ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
{kubernetes}-native platforms such as `minikube`, `microk8s`, `k8s`, and `docker-desktop` are also available.
endif::[]

.Verification

. Wait for the console log output to display the `Command server:deploy has completed successfully.` message:
+
[subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
✔ Retrieving {prod} server URL...<ECLIPSE_CHE_URL>
   ✔ {prod} status check
Command server:deploy has completed successfully.
----

. Use the following command for correct boolean verification:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ {prod-cli} get checluster -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.server.customCheProperties.CHE_MULTIUSER}'
----
+
If the output of the command is `false`, {prod-short} has been successfully configured in single-user mode.
