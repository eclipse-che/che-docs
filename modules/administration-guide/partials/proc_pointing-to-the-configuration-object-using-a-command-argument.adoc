= Configuring {prod-cli} to use a backup server using the configuration object

You can configure {prod-cli} to use a backup server by passing in relevant environment variables for the chosen backup server.

NOTE: As an alternative to the following procedure, you can point directly to the backup server configuration object using the `--backup-server-config-name` command argument or the `BACKUP_SERVER_CONFIG_NAME` environment variable. See xref:managing-backups-of-prod-short-instances-using-custom-resources.adoc[].
