= Collecting {devworkspace} operator metrics with Prometheus

[role="_abstract"]
This section describes how to use the Prometheus to collect, store, and query metrics about the {devworkspace} operator.

.Prerequisites

* The link:https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator/blob/v0.10.0/deploy/deployment/kubernetes/objects/devworkspace-controller-metrics.Service.yaml[`devworkspace-controller-metrics` service] is exposing metrics on port `8443`.

* The `devworkspace-webhookserver` service is exposing metrics on port `9443`. By default, the service exposes metrics on port `9443`.

* Prometheus 2.26.0 or later is running. The Prometheus console is running on port `9090` with a corresponding *service* and *route*. See link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[First steps with Prometheus].

.Procedure

. Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` to bind the `ServiceAccount` associated with Prometheus to the link:https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator/blob/main/deploy/deployment/kubernetes/objects/devworkspace-controller-metrics-reader.ClusterRole.yaml[devworkspace-controller-metrics-reader] `ClusterRole`.
Without the `ClusterRoleBinding`, you cannot access {devworkspace} metrics because they are protected with role-based access control (RBAC).

----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: devworkspace-controller-metrics-binding
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: <ServiceAccount name associated with the Prometheus Pod>
    namespace: <Prometheus namespace>
roleRef:

  name: devworkspace-controller-metrics-reader
----
====

. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the `8443` port exposed by the `devworkspace-controller-metrics` service, and `9443` port exposed by the `devworkspace-webhookserver` service.

.Prometheus configuration example
====
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
data:
  prometheus.yml: |-
      global:
        scrape_interval:     5s             <1>
        evaluation_interval: 5s             <2>
      scrape_configs:                       <3>
        - job_name: 'DevWorkspace'
          authorization:
            type: Bearer
            credentials_file: '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'
          tls_config:
            insecure_skip_verify: true
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['devworkspace-controller-metrics:8443']  <4>
        - job_name: 'DevWorkspace webhooks'
          authorization:
            type: Bearer
            credentials_file: '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'
          tls_config:
            insecure_skip_verify: true
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['devworkspace-webhookserver:9443']  <5>
----
====

<1> Rate at which a target is scraped.
<2> Rate at which recording and alerting rules are re-checked.
<3> Resources that Prometheus monitors. In the default configuration, two jobs (`DevWorkspace` and `DevWorkspace webhooks`), scrape the time series data exposed by the `devworkspace-controller-metrics` and `devworkspace-webhookserver` services.
<4> Scrape metrics from the `8443` port.
<5> Scrape metrics from the `9443` port.

.Verification steps

* Use the Prometheus console to view targets and metrics.
