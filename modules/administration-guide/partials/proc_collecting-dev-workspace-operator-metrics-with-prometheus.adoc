= Collecting {devworkspace} Operator metrics with Prometheus

[role="_abstract"]
To use Prometheus to collect, store, and query metrics about the {devworkspace} Operator:

.Prerequisites

* The `devworkspace-controller-metrics` Service is exposing metrics on port `8443`. This is preconfigured by default.

* The `devworkspace-webhookserver` Service is exposing metrics on port `9443`. This is preconfigured by default.

* Prometheus 2.26.0 or later is running. The Prometheus console is running on port `9090` with a corresponding Service. See link:https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/[First steps with Prometheus].

.Procedure

. Create a ClusterRoleBinding to bind the ServiceAccount associated with Prometheus to the link:https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator/blob/main/deploy/deployment/kubernetes/objects/devworkspace-controller-metrics-reader.ClusterRole.yaml[devworkspace-controller-metrics-reader] ClusterRole. For the xref:installing-prometheus-and-grafana.adoc[example monitoring stack], the name of the ServiceAccount to be be used is `prometheus`.
+
NOTE: Without the ClusterRoleBinding, you cannot access {devworkspace} metrics because access is protected with role-based access control (RBAC).

.ClusterRoleBinding
====
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: devworkspace-controller-metrics-binding
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: prometheus
    namespace: monitoring
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: devworkspace-controller-metrics-reader
----
====

. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from port `8443` exposed by the `devworkspace-controller-metrics` Service and from port `9443` exposed by the `devworkspace-webhookserver` Service.
+
NOTE: The xref:installing-prometheus-and-grafana.adoc[example monitoring stack] already creates the `prometheus-config` ConfigMap with an empty configuration. To provide the Prometheus configuration details, edit the `data` field of the ConfigMap.

.Prometheus configuration

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: prometheus-config
  namespace: monitoring
data:
  prometheus.yml: |-
      global:
        scrape_interval: 5s <1>
        evaluation_interval: 5s <2>
      scrape_configs: <3>
        - job_name: 'DevWorkspace'
          scheme: https
          authorization:
            type: Bearer
            credentials_file: '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'
          tls_config:

          static_configs:
            - targets: ['devworkspace-controller-metrics.__<DWO_{orch-namespace}>__:8443'] <4>
        - job_name: 'DevWorkspace webhooks'
          scheme: https
          authorization:
            type: Bearer
            credentials_file: '/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token'
          tls_config:
            insecure_skip_verify: true
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['devworkspace-webhookserver.__<DWO_{orch-namespace}>__:9443'] <5>
----
<1> The rate at which a target is scraped.
<2> The rate at which the recording and alerting rules are re-checked.
<3> The resources that Prometheus monitors. In the default configuration, two jobs, `DevWorkspace` and `DevWorkspace webhooks`, scrape the time series data exposed by the `devworkspace-controller-metrics` and `devworkspace-webhookserver` Services.
<4> The scrape target for the metrics from port `8443`. Replace `__<DWO_{orch-namespace}>__` with the {orch-namespace} where the `devworkspace-controller-metrics` `Service` is located.
<5> The scrape target for the metrics from port `9443`. Replace `__<DWO_{orch-namespace}>__` with the {orch-namespace} where the `devworkspace-webhookserver` `Service` is located.
====

. Scale the `Prometheus` Deployment down and up to read the updated ConfigMap from the previous step.
+
[source,terminal,subs="+attributes,quotes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} scale --replicas=0 deployment/prometheus -n monitoring && {orch-cli} scale --replicas=1 deployment/prometheus -n monitoring
----

.Verification

. Use port forwarding to access the `Prometheus` Service locally:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+attributes,quotes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090 -n monitoring
----
. Verify that all targets are up by viewing the targets endpoint at `localhost:9090/targets`.
. Use the Prometheus console to view and query metrics:
** The metrics are available at `localhost:9090/metrics`.
** The metrics can be queried from `localhost:9090/graph`.
