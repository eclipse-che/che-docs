[id="postgresql_{context}"]
= PostgreSQL

{prod-short} server uses the PostgreSQL database to persist user configurations: workspaces metadata and Git credentials.

The {prod-short} deployment starts a dedicated PostgreSQL instance in the `postgres` Deployment. 
However, this deployment does not support full lifecycle capabilities, such as backups and recovery. For a business-critical setup, use an external database with the following recommended disaster-recovery options:

* High Availability (HA)
* Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)
