= Adding or removing extensions in the embedded Open VSX registry instance

You can add or remove extensions in the embedded Open VSX registry instance. This results in a custom build of the Open VSX registry that can be used in your organizationâ€™s workspaces. 

pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.TermsErrors = NO -->]

TIP: To get the latest security fixes after a {prod-short} update, rebuild your container based on the latest tag or SHA.

pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.TermsErrors = YES -->]

.Procedure

. Get the publisher and extension name of each chosen extension:

.. Find the extension on the link:https://open-vsx.org/[Open VSX registry website] and copy the URL of the extension's listing page and extension's version.

.. Extract the __<publisher>__ and __<extension>__ name from the copied URL:

----
https://open-vsx.org/extension/__<publisher>__/__<name>__
----
+
[TIP]
====

If the extension is only available from link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode[Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace], but not link:https://open-vsx.org[Open VSX], you can ask the extension publisher to also publish it on link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org] according to these link:https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Publishing-Extensions#how-to-publish-an-extension[instructions], potentially using this link:https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-vs-code-extension[GitHub action].

If the extension publisher is unavailable or unwilling to publish the extension to link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org], and if there is no Open VSX equivalent of the extension, consider link:https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/issues[reporting an issue] to the Open VSX team.

. Build the custom plugin registry image and update CheCluster custom resource:

[TIP]
====

* During the build process, each extension will be verified for compatibility with the version of Visual Studio Code used in {prod-short}.

====

.. Using {prod-short} instance:

... Login to your {prod-short} instance as an administrator.

.. Using Linux operating system:

[TIP]
====

* Podman and NodeJS version 18.20.3 or higher should be installed in the system.

** To add extensions, add the publisher, name and extension version to the `openvsx-sync.json` file.
** To remove extensions, remove the publisher, name and extension version from the `openvsx-sync.json` file.
** Use the following JSON syntax:

[source,json,subs="+quotes"]
----
    {
        "id": "__<publisher>__.__<name>__",
        "version": "__<extension_version>__"
    }
----
+
[TIP]
====

* If you have a closed-source extension or an extension developed only for internal use in your organization, you can add the extension directly from a `.vsix` file by using a URL accessible to your custom plugin registry container:
+
[source,json,subs="+quotes"]
----
    {
        "id": "__<publisher>__.__<name>__",
        "download": "__<url_to_download_vsix_file>__",
        "version": "__<extension_version>__"
    }
----

* Read the link:https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU[Terms of Use] for the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode[Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace] before using its resources.

====

... Build the plugin registry container image and publish it to a container registry such as link:https://quay.io/[quay.io]:

.... {empty}
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ ./build.sh -o __<username>__ -r quay.io -t custom
----

.... {empty}
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {docker-cli} push quay.io/__<username/plugin_registry:custom>__
----

... Edit the `CheCluster` custom resource in your organization's cluster to point to the image (for example, on link:https://quay.io/[quay.io]) and save the changes:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
spec:
  components:
    pluginRegistry:
      deployment:
        containers:
          - image: quay.io/__<username/plugin_registry:custom>__
      openVSXURL: '' 
----

.Verification

. Check that the `plugin-registry` pod has restarted and is running.

. Restart the workspace and check the available extensions in the *Extensions* view of the workspace IDE.
