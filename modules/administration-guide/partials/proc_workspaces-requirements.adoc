= Workspaces requirements

This section describes how to calculate the resources required for a workspace. That is the sum of the resources required for each container of the workspace. 

.Procedure

. Identify the workspace components explicitly specified in the `components` section of the devfile.

. Identify the implicit workspace components.

NOTE: {prod-short} implicitly loads the default `theia-ide`, `che-machine-exec`, `che-gateway` containers. 

. Calculate the requirements for each component.
