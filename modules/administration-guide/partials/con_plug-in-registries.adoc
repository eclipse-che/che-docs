// Module included in the following assemblies:

// {prod-id-short}-workspace-controller-with-devworkspace

[id="plug-in-registries_{context}"]
= Plug-in registries

Each {prod-short} workspace starts with a specific editor and set of associated extensions.
The {prod-short} plug-in registries provides the list of available editors and editor extensions. 
A Devfile v2 fragment describes each editor or extension.
A plug-in registry is a static website running in a container.
The {prod-short} deployment starts one plug-in registry instance in the `plugin-registry` Deployment.

The following services are reading the content of the registry:

* xref:user-dashboard.adoc[]
// * xref:che-server.adoc[]
// * xref:devworkspace-engine.adoc[]
