[id="{prod-id-short}-devfile-registry-with-dw_{context}"]
= {prod-short} Devfile registry (in the DevWorkspace context)

The {prod-short} devfile registry is a service that provides a list of {prod-short} samples to create ready-to-use workspaces. This list of samples is used in the *Dashboard* -> *Create Workspace* window. The devfile registry runs in a container and can be deployed wherever the user dashboard can connect. The devfiles included in the registry use the v2.1 of the https://docs.devfile.io/devfile/2.1.0/user-guide/index.html[Devfile specification].
