= Grafana dashboard for the {devworkspace} Operator

The example Grafana dashboard link:https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator/blob/main/docs/grafana/grafana-dashboard.json[based on `grafana-dashboard.json`] displays the following metrics from the {devworkspace} Operator.

Average workspace start time:: The average workspace startup duration.
Workspace starts:: The number of successful and failed workspace startups.
Workspace startup duration:: A heatmap that displays workspace startup duration.
{devworkspace} successes / failures:: A comparison between successful and failed {devworkspace} startups.
{devworkspace} failure rate:: The ratio between the number of failed workspace startups and the number of total workspace startups.
{devworkspace} startup failure reasons:: A pie chart that displays the distribution of workspace startup failures:
* `BadRequest`
* `InfrastructureFailure`
* `Unknown`
