The following section describes how to use {prod-cli} to restore the last backed up state of {prod-short}.

include::warning_backup-snapshots-are-bound-to-specific-cluster.adoc[]

.Prerequisites

* A backup. See xref:managing-backups-using-prod-cli.adoc#creating-a-backup-using-prod-cli_{context}[Creating a backup using {prod-cli}].

.Procedure

* Run the following command to recover the last backup:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {prod-cli} server:restore --repository-url=__<repository-url>__ --repository-password=__<repository-password>__
----

NOTE: If the backup server was used before, you can run the `server:restore` command without arguments.
//"was used before"? This is not clear and needs feedback from the author because it could mean either that the server "was set up (before)" or that "a backup was previously recovered from this backup server". max-cx
