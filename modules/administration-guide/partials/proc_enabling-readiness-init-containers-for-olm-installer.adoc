= Enabling and disabling readiness init containers for OLM installer

Readiness init containers are not enabled by default.

To enable or disable readiness init containers for {prod-short} installed using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) installer:

.Prerequisites

* {prod-short} is installed with OLM installer.

.Procedure

. Find the {prod-short} Operator subscription name:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} get subscriptions -n {prod-namespace}
----

. Find the CSV name in the {prod-short} Operator subscription:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} get subscription <subscription-name> -n {prod-namespace} -o yaml | grep installedCSV
----

. Edit the `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) YAML manifest:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} edit csv _<csv-name>_ -n {prod-namespace}
----
. Add (remove) the following environment variable to (from) the Operator Deployment spec:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
 - name: ADD_COMPONENT_READINESS_INIT_CONTAINERS
   value: "true"
----

. Wait for the {prod-short} Operator restart to finish. The restarted Operator will then continue with restarting some of its components.

NOTE: Repeat these steps after each {prod-short} upgrade when a new CSV is created by OLM.
