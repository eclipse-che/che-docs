= Backing up of {prod-short} instances to the internal backup server

:context: backing-up-of-{prod-id-short}-instances-to-the-internal-backup-server

To create backups for testing purposes, you can use the internal backup server. The internal backup server is a REST backup server that is managed by the {prod-short} Operator.

IMPORTANT: The {prod-short} Operator defaults to using the internal backup server for pre-update backups (to allow the {prod-short} version rollback) if multiple backup servers are configured and if the `che.eclipse.org/backup-before-update: true` annotation is added to more than one of the multiple backup servers or is not added to the custom object of any one of the multiple backup servers.
