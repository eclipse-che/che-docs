== Telemetry overview
:context: telemetry-overview

Telemetry is the explicit and ethical collection of operation data. By default, telemetry is not available in {prod}, but in the Che-Theia editor there is an abstract API that allows enabling telemetry using the plug-in mechanism and in the `chectl` command line tool usage data can be collected using segment. This approach is used in the {hosted-che-docs} service where telemetry is enabled for every Che-Theia workspace.

This documentation includes a guide describing how to make your own telemetry client for {prod}, followed by an overview of the link:https://github.com/che-incubator/che-workspace-telemetry-woopra-plugin[{prod} Woopra Telemetry Plugin].

== Use cases
[id="use-cases_{context}"]

{prod} telemetry API allows tracking:

* Duration of a workspace utilization
* User-driven actions such as file editing, committing, and pushing to remote repositories.
* Programming languages and devfiles used in workspaces.

== How it works
[id="how-it-works_{context}"]

When a {devworkspace} starts, the `che-theia` container starts the telemetry plug-in which is responsible for sending telemetry events to a backend. If the `$DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT` environment variable is set in the {devworkspace} Pod, the telemetry plug-in sends events to a backend listening at that port. The backend turns received events into a backend-specific representation of the events and sends them to the configured analytics backend (for example, Segment or Woopra).

== Events sent to the backend by the Che-Theia telemetry plug-in

[cols="2,5", options="header"]
:=== 
 Event: Description 
WORKSPACE_OPENED: Sent when Che-Theia starts running
COMMIT_LOCALLY: Sent when a commit was made locally with the `git.commit` Theia command
PUSH_TO_REMOTE: Sent when a Git push was made with the `git.push` Theia command
EDITOR_USED: Sent when a file was changed within the editor
:=== 

Other events such as `WORKSPACE_INACTIVE` and `WORKSPACE_STOPPED` can be detected within the back-end plug-in.
