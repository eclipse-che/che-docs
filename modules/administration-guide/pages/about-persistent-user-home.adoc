= Persistent user home


{prod} provides a persistent home directory feature that allows each non-ephemeral workspace to have their `/home/user` directory be persisted across workspace restarts.
You can enable this feature in the CheCluster by setting `spec.devEnvironments.persistUserHome.enabled` to `true`.

For newly started workspaces, this feature creates a PVC mounted to the `/home/user` path of the tools container.
In this documentation, a "tools container" will be used to refer to the first container in the devfile.
This container is the container that includes the project source code by default.

When the PVC is mounted for the first time, the persistent volume's content are empty and therefore must be populated with the `/home/user` directory content.

By default, the `persistUserHome` feature creates an init container for each new workspace pod named `init-persistent-home`.
This init container is created with the tools container image and is responsible for running a `stow` command to create symbolic links
in the persistent volume to populate the `/home/user` directory.

NOTE: For files that cannot be symbolically linked to the `/home/user` directory such as the `.viminfo` and `.bashrc` file, `cp` is used instead of `stow`.

The primary function of the `stow` command is to run:
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
stow -t /home/user/ -d /home/tooling/ --no-folding
----

The command above creates symbolic links in `/home/user` for files and directories located in /home/tooling. This populates the persistent volume with symbolic links to the content in `/home/tooling`. As a result, it the `persistentUserHome` feature expects the tooling image to have its `/home/user/` content within `/home/tooling`.

For example, if the tools container image contains files in the `home/tooling` directory such as `.config` and `.config-folder/another-file`, stow will create symbolic links in the persistent volume in the following manner:

.Tools container with `persistUserHome` enabled

The init container writes the output of the `stow` command to `/home/user/.stow.log` and will only run `stow` the first time the persistent volume is mounted to the workspace. 

Using the `stow` command to populate `/home/user` content in the persistent volume provides two main advantages:

. Creating symbolic links is faster and consumes less storage than creating copies of the `/home/user` directory content in the persistent volume. To put it differently, the persistent volume in this case contains symbolic links and not the actual files themselves.
. If the tools image is updated with newer versions of existing binaries, configs, and files, the init container does not need to `stow` the new versions, as the existing symbolic links will link to the newer versions in `/home/tooling` already.

NOTE: If the tooling image is updated with additional binaries or files, they won't be symbolically linked to the `/home/user` directory since the stow command won't be run again. In this case, the user must delete the `/home/user/.stow_completed` file and restart the workspace to rerun stow.

.`persistUserHome` tools image requirements

The `persistUserHome` depends on the tools image used for the workspace. By default {prod-short} uses the Universal Developer Image (UDI) for sample workspaces, which supports `persistUserHome` out of the box.

If you are using a custom image, there are three requirements that should be met to support the `persistUserHome` feature.

. The tools image should contain `stow` version 2.4.0.
. The `$HOME` environment variable is set to `/home/user`.
. In the tools image, the directory that is intended to contain the `/home/user` content is `/home/tooling`.

Due to requirement three, the default UDI image for example adds the `/home/user` content to `/home/tooling` instead, and runs:

[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
RUN stow -t /home/user/ -d /home/tooling/ --no-folding 
----

in the Dockerfile so that files in `/home/tooling` is accessible from `/home/user` even when not using the `persistUserHome` feature.
