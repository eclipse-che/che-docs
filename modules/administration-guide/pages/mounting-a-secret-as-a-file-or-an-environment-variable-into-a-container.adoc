= Mounting a Secret or a ConfigMap as a file or an environment variable into a {prod-short} container

Secrets are {platforms-name} objects that store sensitive data such as:

* usernames
* passwords
* authentication tokens

in an encrypted form.

Users can mount a {platforms-name} Secret that contains sensitive data or a ConfigMap that contains configuration in a {prod-short} managed containers as:

* a file
* an environment variable

The mounting process uses the standard {platforms-name} mounting mechanism, but it requires additional annotations and labeling.
