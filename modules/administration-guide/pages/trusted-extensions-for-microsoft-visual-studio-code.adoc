= Configure trusted extensions for Microsoft Visual Studio Code


You can use the `trustedExtensionAuthAccess` field in the `product.json` file of Visual Studio Code to specify which extensions are trusted to access authentication tokens.
[source,json]
----
	"trustedExtensionAuthAccess": [
		"<publisher1>.<extension1>",
		"<publisher2>.<extension2>"
	]
----

This is particularly useful when you have extensions that require access to services such as GitHub, Microsoft, or any other service that requires OAuth. By adding the extension IDs to this field, you are granting them the permission to access these tokens.

[WARNING]
====
Use the `trustedExtensionAuthAccess` field with caution as it could potentially lead to security risks if misused. Give access only to trusted extensions.
====

.Procedure
Since the Visual Studio Code editor is bundled within `che-code` image, it is possible to change the `product.json` file only when the workspace is started up.
To do that it needs to define __VSCODE_TRUSTED_EXTENSIONS__ environment variable and specify one or several extensions separated by comma.
[source,yaml]
----
   env:
     - name: VSCODE_TRUSTED_EXTENSIONS
       value: "<publisher1>.<extension1>,<publisher2>.<extension2>"
----
The value of the variable will be parsed on the workspace startup and the corresponding `trustedExtensionAuthAccess` section will be added to the `product.json`.
