= Installing {prod-short} in a restricted environment on OpenShift

On an OpenShift cluster operating in a restricted network, public resources are not available.

However, deploying {prod-short} and running workspaces requires the following public resources:

* Operator catalog
* Container images
* Sample projects

To make these resources available, you can replace them with their copy in a registry accessible by the OpenShift cluster.

.Prerequisites

. Install {prod-short} with the configuration set in the `che-operator-cr-patch.yaml` during the previous step:
+

$ {prod-cli} server:deploy \
  --platform=openshift \

  --catalog-source-namespace=openshift-marketplace \

. Allow incoming traffic from the {prod-short} namespace to all Pods in the user {orch-namespace}s. See: xref:configuring-network-policies.adoc[].
