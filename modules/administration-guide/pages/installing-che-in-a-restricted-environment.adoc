= Installing {prod-short} in a restricted environment on OpenShift

On an OpenShift cluster operating in a restricted network, public resources are not available.

However, deploying {prod-short} and running workspaces requires the following public resources:

* Operator catalog
* Container images
* Sample projects

To make these resources available, you can replace them with their copy in a registry accessible by the OpenShift cluster.
