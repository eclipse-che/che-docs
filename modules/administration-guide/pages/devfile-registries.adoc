The {prod-short} devfile registries are services providing a list of sample devfiles to create ready-to-use workspaces.
The xref:dashboard.adoc[] displays the samples list on the *Dashboard* -> *Create Workspace* page.
Each sample includes a Devfile v2.
The {prod-short} deployment starts one devfile registry instance in the `devfile-registry` deployment.
