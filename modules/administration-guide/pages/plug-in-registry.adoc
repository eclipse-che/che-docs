Each {prod-short} workspace starts with a specific editor and set of associated extensions.
The {prod-short} plug-in registry provides the list of available editors and editor extensions. 
A Devfile v2 describes each editor or extension.

The xref:dashboard.adoc[] is reading the content of the registry.
