User workspaces are web IDEs running in containers.

A User workspace is a web application. It consists of microservices running in containers providing all the services of a modern IDE running in your browser:

* Editor
* Language auto-completion
* Language server
* Debugging tools
* Plug-ins
* Application runtimes

A workspace is one {orch-name} Deployment containing the workspace containers and enabled plug-ins, plus related {orch-name} components:

* Containers
* ConfigMaps
* Services
* Endpoints
* Ingresses or Routes
* Secrets
* Persistent Volumes (PVs)

A {prod-short} workspace contains the source code of the projects, persisted in a {platforms-name} Persistent Volume (PV). Microservices have read-write access to this shared directory.

Use the devfile v2 format to specify the tools and runtime applications of a {prod-short} workspace.

The following diagram shows one running {prod-short} workspace and its components.
