Backing up {prod-short} may involve any of the following methods, depending on which data has to be backed up:

* Using {prod-short} Operator to back up and restore {prod-short} instances, involving a xref:supported-restic-compatible-backup-servers.adoc[configured backup server]. {prod-short} instance backups do not include the content of users' workspaces. The backup process can be performed using custom resources or {prod-cli} and is backup server-specific for xref:backups-of-prod-short-instances-to-a-rest-backup-server.adoc[REST], xref:backups-of-prod-short-instances-to-amazon-s3.adoc[Amazon S3], and xref:backups-of-prod-short-instances-to-an-sftp-backup-server.adoc[SFTP]. For testing the backup process in a non-production environment, {prod} offers the xref:backups-of-prod-short-instances-to-the-internal-backup-server.adoc[internal backup server]. Restoration can be performed by xref:restoring-a-prod-short-instance-from-a-backup.adoc#restoring-a-prod-short-instance-from-a-backup-using-the-checlusterrestore-object_{context}[custom resources] or xref:restoring-a-prod-short-instance-from-a-backup.adoc#restoring-a-prod-short-instance-from-a-backup-using-prod-cli_{context}[{prod-cli}].
