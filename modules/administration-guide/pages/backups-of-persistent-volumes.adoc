Persistent Volumes (PVs) store the {prod-short} workspace data similarly to how workspace data is stored for desktop IDEs on the local hard disk drive.

To prevent data loss, back up PVs periodically.

The recommended approach is to use storage-agnostic tools for backing up and restoring {platforms-name} resources, including PVs.
