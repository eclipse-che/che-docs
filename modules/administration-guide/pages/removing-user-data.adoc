= Removing user data

== Removing user data according to GDPR


You can remove the {prod-short} userâ€™s data using the {prod-short} API.
Following this procedure makes the service compliant to EU General Data Protection Regulation (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation[GDPR]) that enforces the right for individuals to have personal data erased.

.Prerequisites

* An active session with administrative permissions to {prod-short}. See xref:configuring-the-administrative-user.adoc[].

* An active `oc` session with administrative permissions to the OpenShift cluster. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp4-ver}/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI].

[WARNING]: 
The `pass:c,m,a,q[+https:+//__<{prod-host}>__]/swagger/#/user/find_1` and `pass:c,m,a,q[+https:+//__<{prod-host}>__]/swagger/#/user/remove` endpoints are deprecated. 
Information about new users is no longer stored in the PostgreSQL database. If the endpoints return a `404` response, there is no user entry in the database and you can skip the first two steps of the procedure.
