= Removing user data in compliance with the GDPR

You can remove a userâ€™s data in compliance with the link:https://gdpr.eu/[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)] that enforces the right of individuals to have their personal data erased.

WARNING: Removing user data as follows is irreversible! All removed data is deleted and unrecoverable!

.Prerequisites

* An active session with administrative permissions for {prod-short}. See xref:configuring-the-administrative-user.adoc[].

* An active `oc` session with administrative permissions for the OpenShift cluster. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp4-ver}/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI].

.Procedure

. If the {prod-short} instance has been upgraded since a previous release in which user data were stored in a PostgreSQL database, then first use the deprecated endpoints:
+
.. Go to `pass:c,m,a,q[{prod-url}]/swagger/#/user/find_1`.
.. Select *Try it out* -> *name*: __<username>__ -> *Execute* to get the user *id*.
.. Find the *id* value in the *Response body*.
+
If the response is *404*, which means the user is not in the database, skip to step two.
.. Go to `pass:c,m,a,q[{prod-url}]/swagger/#/user/remove`.
.. Select *Try it out* -> *id*: __<id>__ -> *Execute* to remove the user's data that is managed by the {prod-short} server. 
.. Verify that you got a *204* response.

. Delete the user {orch-namespace} to remove all {orch-name} resources bound to the user, such as workspaces, Secrets, and ConfigMaps.
