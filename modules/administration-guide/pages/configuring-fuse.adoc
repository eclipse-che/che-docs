= Configuring fuse-overlayfs

By default, the Universal Developer Image (UDI) contains Podman and Buildah which you can use to build and push container images within a workspace.
However, Podman and Buildah in the UDI are configured to use the `vfs` storage driver which does not provide copy-on-write support.
For more efficient image management, use the fuse-overlayfs storage driver which supports copy-on-write in rootless environments.


== Enabling container access to /dev/fuse for OpenShift

To use fuse-overlayfs, you must make `/dev/fuse` accessible to workspace containers first.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure is not necessary for OpenShift versions 4.15 and later, since the `/dev/fuse` device is available by default. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/release_notes/ocp-4-15-release-notes.html#ocp-4-15-nodes-dev-fuse[Release Notes].
====

[WARNING]
====
Creating `MachineConfig` resources on an OpenShift cluster is a potentially dangerous task, as you are making advanced, system-level changes to the cluster.

View the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp4-ver}/post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.html#machine-config-overview-post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[MachineConfig documentation] for more details and possible risks.

====

.Prerequisites

* The link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp4-ver}/installing/install_config/installing-customizing.html#installation-special-config-butane-install_installing-customizing[Butane] tool (`butane`) is installed in the operating system you are using.

* An active `{orch-cli}` session with administrative permissions to the destination OpenShift cluster. See {orch-cli-link}.

.Procedure

. Set the environment variable based on the type of your OpenShift cluster: a single node cluster, or a multi node cluster with separate control plane and worker nodes.
+
* For a single node cluster, set:
+
[subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
$ NODE_ROLE=master
----
+
* For a multi node cluster, set:
[subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
+
----
$ NODE_ROLE=worker
----

. Set the environment variable for the OpenShift Butane config version. This variable is the major and minor version of the OpenShift cluster. For example, `4.12.0`, `4.13.0`, or `4.14.0`.
+
[subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
$ VERSION=4.12.0
----
+
. Create a `MachineConfig` resource that creates a drop-in CRI-O configuration file named `99-podman-fuse` in the `NODE_ROLE` nodes. This configuration file makes access to the `/dev/fuse` device possible for certain pods.

. Once all nodes with the `worker` role have a status `Ready`, `/dev/fuse` will be available to any pod with the following annotations.

.Verification steps

. Get the name of a node with a `worker` role:

----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Open an `oc debug` session to a worker node.
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ oc debug node/__<nodename>__
----

. Verify that a new CRI-O config file named `99-podman-fuse` exists.
