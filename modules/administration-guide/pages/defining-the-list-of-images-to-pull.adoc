= Defining the list of images to pull

The {image-puller-name-short} can pre-pull most images, including scratch images such as `che-machine-exec`. However, images that mount volumes in the Dockerfile, such as `traefik`, are not supported for pre-pulling on OpenShift 3.11.

.Procedure

. Gather a list of relevant container images to pull by navigating to the `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]/plugin-registry/v3/external_images.txt` URL.

. Determine images from the list for pre-pulling. For faster workspace startup times, consider pulling workspace related images such as `universal-developer-image`, `che-code`, and `che-gateway`.
