= Security best practices for {prod}

Get an overview of key best security practices for {prod} that can help you
foster a more resilient development environment.

{prod} runs on top of OpenShift, which provides the platform, and the foundation for the products functioning on top of it. OpenShift documentation is the entry point for security hardening.

.Project isolation in OpenShift

In OpenShift, project isolation is similar to {namespace} isolation in {kubernetes} but is achieved through the concept of projects. A project in OpenShift is a top-level organizational unit that provides isolation and collaboration between different applications, teams, or workloads within a cluster.

By default, {prod-short} provisions a unique `<username>-devspaces` project for each user. Alternatively, the cluster administrator can disable project self-provisioning on the OpenShift level, and turn off automatic {namespace} provisioning in the CheCluster custom resource:

[source, yaml]
----
devEnvironments:
  defaultNamespace:
    autoProvision: false
----
include::example$snip_che-curated-access.adoc[]

.Role-based access control (RBAC)

By default, the {prod-short} operator creates the following ClusterRoles:

* `<namespace>-cheworkspaces-clusterrole`
* `<namespace>-cheworkspaces-devworkspace-clusterrole`

[NOTE]
====
The `<namespace>` prefix corresponds to the project name where the {prod} CheCluster CR is located.
====

The first time a user accesses {prod}, the corresponding RoleBinding is created in the `<username>-devspaces` project.

All resources and actions you can grant users permission to use in their {namespace} is listed below.

.Dev environment isolation

Isolation of the development environments is implemented using OpenShift projects.
Every developer has a project in which the following objects are created and managed:

* Cloud Development Environment (CDE) Pods, including the IDE server.
* Secrets containing developer credentials, such as a Git token, SSH keys, and a Kubernetes token.
* ConfigMaps with developer-specific configuration, such as the Git name and email.
* Volumes that persist data such as the source code, even when the CDE Pod is stopped.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Access to the resources in a namespace must be limited to the developer owning it. Granting read access to another developer is equivalent to sharing the developer credentials and should be avoided.
====

.Enhanced authorization

The current trend is
to split an infrastructure into several "fit for purpose" clusters
instead of having a gigantic monolith OpenShift cluster.
However, administrators might still want to provide granular access,
and restrict the availability of certain functionalities to particular users.

[NOTE]
====
A "fit for purpose" OpenShift cluster refers to a cluster that is specifically designed
and configured to meet the requirements and goals of a particular use case or workload.
It is tailored to optimize performance, resource utilization,
and other factors based on the characteristics of the workloads it will be managing.
For {prod}, it is recommended to have this type of cluster provisioned.
====

For this purpose,
optional properties that you can use to set up granular access for different groups and users are available in the CheCluster Custom Resource:

* `allowUsers`
* `allowGroups`
* `denyUsers`
* `denyGroups`

Below is an example of access configuration:

[source, code]
----
 networking:
    auth:
      advancedAuthorization:
        allowUsers:
          - user-a
          - user-b
        denyUsers:
          - user-c
        allowGroups:
          - openshift-group-a
          - openshift-group-b
        denyGroups:
          - openshift-group-c
----

[NOTE]
====
Users in the `denyUsers` and `denyGroup`  categories will not be able to use {prod} and will see a warning when trying to access the User Dashboard.
====

.Authentication

Only authenticated OpenShift users can access {prod}.
The Gateway Pod uses a role-based access control (RBAC) subsystem
to determine whether a developer is authorized to access a Cloud Development Environment (CDE) or not.

The CDE Gateway container checks the developer's {kubernetes} roles.
If their roles allow access to the CDE Pod, the connection to the development environment is allowed.
By default, only the owner of the {namespace} has access to the CDE Pod.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Access to the resources in a namespace must be limited to the developer owning it. Granting `read` access to another developer is equivalent to sharing the developer credentials and should be avoided.
====

.Security context and security context constraint

{prod} adds `SETGID` and `SETUID` capabilities to the specification of the CDE Pod container security context:

[source, code]
----
"spec": {
  "containers": [
    "securityContext": {
            "allowPrivilegeEscalation": true,
            "capabilities": {
               "add": ["SETGID", "SETUID"],
               "drop": ["ALL","KILL","MKNOD"]
            },
            "readOnlyRootFilesystem": false,
            "runAsNonRoot": true,
            "runAsUser": 1001110000
   }
  ]
 }
----

This provides the ability for users to build container images from within a CDE.

By default, {prod} assigns a specific `SecurityContextConstraint` (SCC) to the users that allows them to start a Pod with such capabilities. This SCC grants more capabilities to the users compared to the default `restricted` SCC but less capability compared to the `anyuid` SCC. This default SCC is pre-created in the {prod-short} namespace and named `container-build`.

Setting the following property in the CheCluster Custom Resource prevents assigning extra capabilities and SCC to users:

[source, code]
----
spec:
  devEnvironments:
    disableContainerBuildCapabilities: true
----

.Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges

Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges are {kubernetes} features you can use to help prevent bad actors or resource abuse within a cluster.
They help in controlling and managing resource consumption by pods and containers.
By combining Resource Quotas and Limit Ranges,
you can enforce project-specific policies to prevent bad actors from consuming excessive resources.

These mechanisms contribute to better resource management, stability, and fairness within an OpenShift cluster.
More details about link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/applications/quotas/quotas-setting-per-project.html[Resource Quotas] and link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-limit-ranges.html[Limit Ranges] are available in the OpenShift documentation.

.Disconnected environment

An air-gapped OpenShift disconnected cluster refers to an OpenShift cluster
isolated from the internet or any external network.
This isolation is often done for security reasons,
to protect sensitive or critical systems from potential cyber threats.
In an air-gapped environment,
the cluster cannot access external repositories or registries to download container images, updates, or dependencies.

{prod} is supported and can be installed in a restricted environment.
include::example$snip_che-installation-instructions.adoc[]

.Managing extensions

By default, {prod}
includes the embedded Open VSX registry
which contains a limited set of extensions used by Microsoft Visual Studio Code -
Open Source editor.
Alternatively, cluster administrators can specify a different plugin registry in the Custom Resource, e.g.
https://open-vsx.org that contains thousands of extensions.
They can also build a custom Open VSX registry.
include::example$snip_che-managing-extensions.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Installing extra extensions increases potential risks. To minimize these risks, make sure to only install extensions from reliable sources and regularly update them.
====

.Secrets

Keep sensitive data stored as {kubernetes} secrets in the users’
namespaces confidential (e.g. Personal Access Tokens (PAT), and SSH keys).

.Git repositories

It is crucial to operate within Git repositories that you are familiar with and that you trust. Before incorporating new dependencies into the repository, verify that they are well-maintained and regularly release updates to address any identified security vulnerabilities in their code.
