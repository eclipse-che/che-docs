= Configuring network policies

By default, all Pods in a {orch-name} cluster can communicate with each other even if they are in different namespaces.
In the context of {prod-short}, this makes it possible for a workspace Pod in one user {orch-namespace} to send traffic to another workspace Pod in a different user {orch-namespace}.

For security, multitenant isolation could be configured by using NetworkPolicy objects to restrict all incoming communication to Pods in a user {orch-namespace}.
However, Pods in the {prod-short} {orch-namespace} must be able to communicate with Pods in user {orch-namespace}s.

For a cluster with network restrictions such as multitenant isolation already configured, you must apply the `allow-from-eclipse-che.yaml` NetworkPolicy to each user {orch-namespace}. The `allow-from-eclipse-che` NetworkPolicy allows incoming traffic from the {prod-short} namespace to all Pods in the user {orch-namespace}.
