A configured backup server is a prerequisite to managing {prod-short} backups xref:managing-backups-of-prod-short-instances-using-prod-cli.adoc[using {prod-cli}] and xref:managing-backups-of-prod-short-instances-using-custom-resources.adoc[using custom resources] in a production environment.

{prod-short} uses Che Operator and restic for backing up and restoring {prod-short} instances from backup snapshots. To back up, Che Operator gathers the data needed for a backup snapshot, and then restic creates and manages the snapshot. To restore, restic retrieves and decrypts the snapshot, and then Che Operator applies the retrieved data to perform the recovery.

{prod-short} can use the following backup servers that are compatible with restic:
