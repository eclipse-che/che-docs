= Configuring workspaces nodeSelector

This section describes how to configure link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/[`nodeSelector`] for Pods of {prod-short} workspaces.

.Procedure

{prod-short} uses the `CHE_WORKSPACE_POD_NODE__SELECTOR` environment variable to configure `nodeSelector`. This variable may contain a set of comma-separated `key=value` pairs to form the nodeSelector rule, or `NULL` to disable it.

----
CHE_WORKSPACE_POD_NODE__SELECTOR=disktype=ssd,cpu=xlarge,[key=value]
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
`nodeSelector` must be configured during {prod-short} installation. This prevents existing workspaces from failing to run due to volumes affinity conflict caused by existing workspace PVC and Pod being scheduled in different zones.

To avoid Pods and PVCs to be scheduled in different zones on large, multizone clusters, create an additional link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[`StorageClass`] object (pay attention to the `allowedTopologies` field), which will coordinate the PVC creation process.

Pass the name of this newly created `StorageClass` to {prod-short} through the `+CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_PVC_STORAGE__CLASS__NAME+` environment variable. A default empty value of this variable instructs {prod-short} to use the cluster's default `StorageClass`.
