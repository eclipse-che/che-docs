= Applying editor configurations

You can configure Visual Studio Code - Open Source editor by adding configurations to a ConfigMap.
These configurations are applied to any workspace you open.
Once a workspace is started, the editor checks for this ConfigMap and stores configurations to the corresponding config files.

The following sections are currently supported:

* settings.json
* extensions.json

The `settings.json` section contains various settings that allow to customize different parts of the Code - OSS editor. +
The `extensions.json` section contains recommented extensions are installed when a workspace is started.

.Procedure

* Add a new ConfigMap to the user's {orch-namespace}, define the `settings.json`  and `extensions.json` sections, specify the settings you want to add, and the IDs of the extensions you want to install.

.Verification
. Verify that settings defined in the ConfigMap are applied using one of the following methods:
* Use `F1 → Preferences: Open Remote Settings` to check if the defined settings are applied. 
* Ensure that the settings from the ConfigMap are present in the `/checode/remote/data/Machine/settings.json` file by using the `F1 → File: Open File...` command to inspect the file's content.

. Verify that extensions defined in the ConfigMap are applied:
* Go to the `Extensions` view (`F1 → View: Show Extensions`) and check that the extensions are installed
* Ensure that the extensions from the ConfigMap are present in the `.code-workspace` file by using the `F1 → File: Open File...` command. By default, the workspace file is placed at `/projects/.code-workspace`.
