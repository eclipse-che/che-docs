= Applying editor configurations

You can configure Visual Studio Code - Open Source editor by adding configurations to a ConfigMap.
These configurations are applied to any workspace you open.
Once a workspace is started, the editor checks for this ConfigMap and stores configurations to the corresponding config files.

The following sections are currently supported:

* settings.json
* extensions.json
* product.json

The *settings.json* section contains various settings with which you can customize different parts of the Code - OSS editor. +
The *extensions.json* section contains recommended extensions that are installed when a workspace is started. +
The *product.json* section contains properties that you need to add to the editor's *product.json* file. If the property already exists, its value will be updated.

.Procedure

* Add a new ConfigMap to the user's {orch-namespace}, define the `settings.json`  and `extensions.json` sections, specify the settings you want to add, and the IDs of the extensions you want to install.

* Start or restart your workspace 

[NOTE]

Make sure that the Configmap contains data in a valid JSON format.

.Verification
. Verify that settings defined in the ConfigMap are applied using one of the following methods:
* Use `F1 → Preferences: Open Remote Settings` to check if the defined settings are applied. 
* Ensure that the settings from the ConfigMap are present in the `/checode/remote/data/Machine/settings.json` file by using the `F1 → File: Open File...` command to inspect the file's content.

. Verify that extensions defined in the ConfigMap are applied:
* Go to the `Extensions` view (`F1 → View: Show Extensions`) and check that the extensions are installed
* Ensure that the extensions from the ConfigMap are present in the `.code-workspace` file by using the `F1 → File: Open File...` command. By default, the workspace file is placed at `/projects/.code-workspace`.

. Verify that product properties defined in the ConfigMap are being added to the Visual Studio Code *product.json*:
* Open a terminal, run the command `cat /checode/entrypoint-logs.txt | grep "Node.js dir"` and copy the Visual Studio Code path.
* Press `Ctrl + O`, paste the copied path and open *product.json* file.
* Ensure that *product.json* file contains all the properties defined in the ConfigMap.
