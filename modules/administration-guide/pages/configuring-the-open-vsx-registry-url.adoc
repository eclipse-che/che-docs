You can also configure {prod-short} to use another Open VSX registry instance rather than the embedded one.

.Procedure
* Set the URL of your Open VSX registry instance in the CheCluster Custom Resource `spec.components.pluginRegistry.openVSXURL` field.

To ensure the stability and performance of the community-supported Open VSX Registry, API usage is organized into defined tiers. These limits are implemented by the Eclipse Foundation to protect infrastructure from high-frequency automated traffic and to provide consistent service quality for all users.
