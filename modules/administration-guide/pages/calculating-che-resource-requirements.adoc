= Calculating {prod-short} resource requirements

The {prod-short} Operator, {devworkspace} Controller, and user workspaces consist of a set of pods.
The pods contribute to the resource consumption in CPU and memory limits and requests.

.Procedure

. Identify the workspace resource requirements which depend on the devfile that is used for defining the development environment. This includes identifying the workspace components explicitly specified in the `components` section of the devfile.

** Here is an link:https://github.com/che-incubator/quarkus-api-example/blob/main/devfile.yaml[example devfile] with the following components:
+
.`tools`
====
The `tools` component of the devfile defines the following requests and limits:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes,macros"]
----
    memoryLimit: 6G
    memoryRequest: 512M
    cpuRequest: 1000m
    cpuLimit: 4000m
----
====

** During the workspace startup, an internal `che-gateway` container is implicitly provisioned with the following requests and limits:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes,+quotes,macros"]
----
    memoryLimit: 256M
    memoryRequest: 64M
    cpuRequest: 50m
    cpuLimit: 500m
----

. Calculate the sums of the resources required for each workspace. If you intend to use multiple devfiles, repeat this calculation for every expected devfile.

. Multiply the resources calculated per workspace by the number of workspaces that you expect all of your users to run simultaneously.

. Calculate the sums of the requirements for the {prod-short} Operator, Operands, and {devworkspace} Controller.
