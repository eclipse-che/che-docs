:context: calculating-{prod-id-short}-resource-requirements

This section describes how to calculate resources, such as memory and CPU, required to run {prod}.

The {prod-short} Operator, {devworkspace} Controller, and user workspaces consist of a set of pods. Those pods contribute to the resource consumption in terms of CPU and RAM limits and requests.
