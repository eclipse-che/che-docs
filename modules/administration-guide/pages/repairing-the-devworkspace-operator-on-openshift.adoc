= Repairing the {devworkspace} Operator on OpenShift

Under certain conditions, such as https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html[OLM] restart or cluster upgrade, the {prod2} Operator for {prod-short} might automatically install the {devworkspace} Operator even when it is already present on the cluster. In that case, you can repair the {devworkspace} Operator on OpenShift as follows:

.Prerequisites

* An active `{orch-cli}` session as a cluster administrator to the destination OpenShift cluster. See {orch-cli-link}.

* On the *Installed Operators* page of the {platforms-name} web console, you see multiple entries for the {devworkspace} Operator or one entry that is stuck in a loop of *Replacing* and *Pending*.

.Procedure

. Delete the `devworkspace-controller` namespace that contains the failing pod.

. Update `DevWorkspace` and `DevWorkspaceTemplate` Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) by setting the conversion strategy to `None` and removing the entire `webhook` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  ...
  conversion:
    strategy: None
status:
...
----
+
TIP: You can find and edit the `DevWorkspace` and `DevWorkspaceTemplate` CRDs in the *Administrator* perspective of the OpenShift web console by searching for `DevWorkspace` in menu:Administration[CustomResourceDefinitions].
+
NOTE: The `DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig` and `DevWorkspaceRouting` CRDs  have the conversion strategy set to `None` by default.

. Remove the {devworkspace} Operator subscription:
+
----
$ oc delete sub devworkspace-operator \
-n openshift-operators <1>
----
<1> `openshift-operators` or an OpenShift {orch-namespace} where the {devworkspace} Operator is installed.

. Get the {devworkspace} Operator CSVs in the __<devworkspace_operator.vX.Y.Z>__ format:
+
----
$ oc get csv | grep devworkspace
----

. Remove each {devworkspace} Operator CSV:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc delete csv __<devworkspace_operator.vX.Y.Z>__ \
-n openshift-operators <1>
----
<1> `openshift-operators` or an OpenShift {orch-namespace} where the {devworkspace} Operator is installed.

. Re-create the {devworkspace} Operator subscription:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
----
$ cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: devworkspace-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: fast
  name: devworkspace-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  installPlanApproval: Automatic <1>
  startingCSV: devworkspace-operator.v{devworkspace-operator-version-patch}
EOF
----
+
<1> `Automatic` or `Manual`.
+
IMPORTANT: For `installPlanApproval: Manual`, in the *Administrator* perspective of the OpenShift web console, go to menu:Operators[Installed Operators] and select the following for the *{devworkspace} Operator*: menu:Upgrade available[Preview InstallPlan > Approve].

. In the *Administrator* perspective of the OpenShift web console, go to menu:Operators[Installed Operators] and verify the *Succeeded* status of the *{devworkspace} Operator*.
