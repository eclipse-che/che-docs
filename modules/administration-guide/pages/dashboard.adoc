The user dashboard is the landing page of {prod}.
{prod-short} users browse the user dashboard to access and manage their workspaces.
It is a React application. 
The {prod-short} deployment starts it in the `{prod-deployment}-dashboard` Deployment.

It needs access to:

* xref:che-server.adoc[]
* xref:plugin-registry.adoc[]
* {orch-name} API

When the user requests the user dashboard to start a workspace, the user dashboard executes this sequence of actions:

. Sends the repository URL to xref:che-server.adoc[] and expects a devfile in return, when the user is creating a workspace from a remote devfile.
. Reads the devfile describing the workspace.
. Collects the additional metadata from the xref:plugin-registry.adoc[].
. Converts the information into a {devworkspace} Custom Resource.
. Creates the {devworkspace} Custom Resource in the user {orch-namespace} using the {orch-name} API.
. Watches the {devworkspace} Custom Resource status.
. Redirects the user to the running workspace IDE.
