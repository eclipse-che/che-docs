When the user requests the user dashboard to start a workspace, the user dashboard executes this sequence of actions:

. Collects the devfile from the xref:devfile-registries.adoc[], when the user is creating a workspace from a code sample.
. Sends the repository URL to xref:che-server.adoc[] and expects a devfile in return, when the user is creating a workspace from a remote devfile.
. Reads the devfile describing the workspace.
. Collects the additional metadata from the xref:plug-in-registry.adoc[].
. Converts the information into a {devworkspace} Custom Resource.
. Creates the {devworkspace} Custom Resource in the user {orch-namespace} using the {orch-name} API.
. Watches the {devworkspace} Custom Resource status.
. Redirects the user to the running workspace IDE.
