= Caching images for faster workspace start

To improve the start time performance of {prod-short} workspaces,
use the {image-puller-name-short}, a {prod-short}-agnostic component that can be used
to pre-pull images for {platforms-name} clusters.

The {image-puller-name-short} is an
additional {platforms-name} deployment which creates a _DaemonSet_ that can be
configured to pre-pull relevant {prod-short} workspace images on each node.
These images would already be available when a {prod-short} workspace starts,
therefore improving the workspace start time.
