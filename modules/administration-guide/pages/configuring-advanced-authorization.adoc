[NOTE]
====

To allow a user to access {prod-short}, add them to the `allowUsers` list. Alternatively, choose a group the user is a member of and add the group to the `allowGroups` list.
To deny a user access to {prod-short}, add them to the `denyUsers` list. Alternatively, choose a group the user is a member of and add the group to the `denyGroups` list.
If the user is on both `allow` and `deny` lists, they are denied access to {prod-short}.

If `allowUsers` and `allowGroups` are empty, all users are allowed to access {prod-short} except the ones on the `deny` lists.
If `denyUsers` and `denyGroups` are empty, only the users from `allow` lists are allowed to access {prod-short}.

If both `allow` and `deny` lists are empty, all users are allowed to access {prod-short}.
