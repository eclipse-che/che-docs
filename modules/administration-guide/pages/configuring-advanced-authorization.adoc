To allow a user to access {prod-short}, add him to the `allowUsers` list or a group where he is member of to `allowGroups` list.
To deny a user to access {prod-short}, add him to the `denyUsers` list or a group where he is member of to `denyGroups` list.
If user is in both `allow` and `deny` lists, then he is denied access to {prod-short}.
+
If `allowUsers` and `allowGroups` are empty, then all users are allowed to access {prod-short} except ones from `deny` lists.
if `denyUsers` and `denyGroups` are empty, then only users from `allow` lists are allowed to access {prod-short}.
+
If `allow` and `deny` lists are empty, then all users are allowed to access {prod-short}.

. Wait for the rollout of the {prod-short} server components to be completed.
