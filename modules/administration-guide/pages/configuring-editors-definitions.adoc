= Configuring editors definitions

Learn how to configure {prod-short} editor definitions.

.Prerequisites

* An active `{orch-cli}` session with administrative permissions to the {orch-name} cluster. See {orch-cli-link}.

.Procedure

. Create the `my-editor-definition-devfile.yaml` YAML file with the editor definition configuration.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you provide the actual values for `publisher` and `version` under `metadata.attributes`.
They are used to construct the editor id along with editor name in the following format `publisher/name/version`.
====
+
Below you can find the supported values, including optional ones:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
# Version of the devile schema
schemaVersion: 2.2.2
# Meta information of the editor
metadata:
  # (MANDATORY) The editor name
  name: EditorName
  displayName: Display Name
  description: Run Editor Foo on top of Eclipse Che
  # (OPTIONAL) Array of tags of the current editor. The Tech-Preview tag means the option is considered experimental and is not recommended for production environments. While it can include new features and improvements, it may still contain bugs or undergo significant changes before reaching a stable version.
  tags:
    - Tech-Preview
  # Additional attributes
  attributes:
    title: This is my editor
    # (MANDATORY) The publisher name
    publisher: publisher
    # (MANDATORY) The editor version
    version: version

            # An attribute that instructs the service to automatically redirect the unauthenticated requests for current user authentication.

          protocol: https

    volume: {ephemeral: true}
# (OPTIONAL) Bindings of commands to events. Each command is referred-to by its name
events:
  # IDs of commands that should be executed before the devworkspace start. These commands would typically be executed in an init container
  preStart:
    - init-container-command
  # IDs of commands that should be executed after the devworkspace has completely started. In the case of Che-Code, these commands should be executed after all plugins and extensions have started, including project cloning. This means that those commands are not triggered until the user opens the IDE within the browser
  postStart:
    - init-che-code-command
# (OPTIONAL) Predefined, ready-to-use, devworkspace-related commands
commands:
    # Mandatory identifier that allows referencing this command
  - id: init-container-command
    apply:
      # Describes the component for the apply command
      component: che-code-injector
    # Mandatory identifier that allows referencing this command
  - id: init-che-code-command
    # CLI Command executed in an existing component container

      # Describes component for the exec command

----

. Create a ConfigMap with the editor definition content:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
{orch-cli} create configmap my-editor-definition --from-file=my-editor-definition-devfile.yaml -n {prod-namespace}
----

. Add the required labels to the ConfigMap:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
{orch-cli} label configmap my-editor-definition app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org app.kubernetes.io/component=editor-definition -n {prod-namespace}
----

. Refresh the {prod-short} Dashboard page to see new available editor.
