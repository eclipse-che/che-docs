= Finding the FQDN of your organization's instance of {prod-short}

You can get the FQDN of your organization's instance of {prod-short} from the command line or in the OpenShift web console.

TIP: You can find the FQDN for your organization's {prod-short} instance in the *Administrator* view of the OpenShift web console as follows. Go to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* -> *Installed Operators* -> *{prod} instance Specification* -> *{prod-checluster}* -> *{prod} URL*.

Because the FQDN of {prod-short} is part of the dashboard URL, users get the FQDN whenever they open the dashboard.

.Prerequisites

* An active `oc` session with administrative permissions to the OpenShift cluster. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp4-ver}/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI].
* `{prod-cli}`. See: xref:installing-the-chectl-management-tool.adoc[].

.Procedure

. Run the following command:
+
[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {prod-cli} dsc server:status
----
. Copy the *{prod} URL* without the trailing `/dashboard/`.
