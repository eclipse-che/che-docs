A configured backup server is a prerequisite to managing {prod-short} backups xref:managing-backups-of-prod-short-instances-using-prod-cli.adoc[using {prod-cli}] and xref:managing-backups-of-prod-short-instances-using-custom-resources.adoc[using custom resources] in a production environment. The backup tool used and the supported types of backup servers are outlined as follows.

In a non-production environment, the optional xref:configuring-prod-short-to-use-the-internal-backup-server_{context}[internal backup server] can be configured to create backups for testing purposes.
