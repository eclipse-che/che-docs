= Extensions for Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source

To manage extensions, link:https://github.com/microsoft/vscode[this IDE] uses one of these link:https://open-vsx.org/about[Open VSX] registry instances:

* The public, primary link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org] registry.
* The embedded instance of the Open VSX registry that runs in the `plugin-registry` pod of {prod-short} to support air-gapped, offline, and proxy-restricted environments. The embedded Open VSX registry contains only a subset of the extensions published on link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org]. This subset can be customized.
* A standalone Open VSX registry instance, deployed on a network accessible from {prod-short} workspace pods.
