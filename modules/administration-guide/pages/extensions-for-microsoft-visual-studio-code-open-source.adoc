= Extensions for Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source

To manage extensions for link:https://github.com/microsoft/vscode[Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source IDE], {prod-short} uses one of the link:https://open-vsx.org/about[Open VSX] registry instances:

* The public, primary link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org] registry.
* The embedded, locally cached instance of the Open VSX registry that runs in the `plugin-registry` pod of {prod-short} to support air-gapped, offline, and proxy-restricted environments, containing only a subset of the extensions published on link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org].
* Your own custom build of the embedded Open VSX registry, for use in your organization's workspaces.

If it can be resolved from within your cluster, the default Open VSX registry at `pass:c,a,q[https://open-vsx.org]` will be used; if not, default is the embedded, locally cached Open VSX registry within the {prod-short} `plugin-registry` pod.
