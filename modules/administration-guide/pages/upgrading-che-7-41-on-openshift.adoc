= Upgrading {prod-prev-short} {prod-last-version-pre-dwo} on OpenShift

The workspace engine and authentication system used up to and including {prod-prev-short} {prod-last-version-pre-dwo} are deprecated. Due to that, upgrading {prod-prev-short} {prod-last-version-pre-dwo} to {prod-short} {prod-ver} involves running upgrade scripts.
