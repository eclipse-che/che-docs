= Installing {prod-short} on OpenShift using the web console

If you have trouble xref:installing-che-on-openshift-using-cli.adoc[installing {prod-short} on the command line], you can install it through the OpenShift web console.

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift web console session by a cluster administrator. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp4-ver}/web_console/web-console.html[Accessing the web console].

* An active `oc` session with administrative permissions to the OpenShift cluster. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{ocp4-ver}/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[Getting started with the OpenShift CLI].

* For a repeat installation on the same OpenShift cluster: you uninstalled the previous {prod-short} instance according to xref:uninstalling-che.adoc[].

.Procedure

. In the *Administrator* view of the OpenShift web console, go to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub* and search for `{prod}`.

. Install the {prod} Operator.

+
CAUTION: The {prod} Operator depends on the {devworkspace} Operator. If you install the {prod} Operator manually to a non-default namespace, ensure that the {devworkspace} Operator is also installed in the same namespace. This is required as the Operator Lifecycle Manager will attempt to install the {devworkspace} Operator as a dependency within the {prod} Operator namespace, potentially resulting in two conflicting installations of the {devworkspace} Operator if the latter is installed in a different namespace. 

CAUTION: If you want to onboard link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/web_console/web_terminal/installing-web-terminal.html[Web Terminal Operator] on the cluster make sure to use the same installation namespace as {prod} Operator since both depend on {devworkspace} Operator. Web Terminal Operator, {prod} Operator, and {devworkspace} Operator must be installed in the same namespace.

. Create the `{prod-namespace}` project in OpenShift as follows:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
----
oc create namespace {prod-namespace}
----

. Go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* -> *{prod} instance Specification* -> *Create CheCluster* -> *YAML view*.

. In the *YAML view*, replace `namespace: openshift-operators` with `namespace: {prod-namespace}`.

. Select *Create*.

.Verification

pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = NO -->]

. In *{prod} instance Specification*, go to *{prod-checluster}*, landing on the *Details* tab.

pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = YES -->]

. Under *Message*, check that there is *None*, which means no errors.

. Under *{prod} URL*, wait until the URL of the {prod-short} instance appears, and then open the URL to check the {prod-short} dashboard.

. In the *Resources* tab, view the resources for the {prod-short} deployment and their status.
