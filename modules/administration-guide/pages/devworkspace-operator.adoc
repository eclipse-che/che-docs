= {devworkspace} Operator overview


The {devworkspace} Operator (DWO) is a dependency of {prod-short}, and is an integral part of how {prod-short} functions. To summarize, one of DWO's main responsibilities is to reconcile {devworkspace} custom resources (CR).

The {devworkspace} CR is a {orch-name} resource representation of a {prod-short} workspace. Whenever a user creates a workspace using the {prod-short} Dashboard, {prod-short} will create a {devworkspace} CR in the cluster under the hood. For every {prod-short} workspace, there is an underlying {devworkspace} CR on the cluster.

Figure 1 shows an example of a {devworkspace} CR in a cluster:

When creating a workspace with {prod-short} with a devfile, the {devworkspace} CR will contain the devfile details. Additionally, {prod-short} will add the editor definition into the {devworkspace} CR depending on which editor was chosen for the workspace. {prod-short} will also add attributes to the {devworkspace} which further configures the workspace depending on how the CheCluster CR was configured.

A DevWorkspaceTemplate is a custom resource that defines a reusable `spec.template` for {devworkspace}s.

When a workspace is started, DWO will read the corresponding {devworkspace} CR and create a workspace pod running the container(s) defined in the devfile.

.Custom Resources overview

The following Custom Resource Definitions are provided by the {devworkspace} Operator:

* {devworkspace}
* DevWorkspaceTemplate
* DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig
* DevWorkspaceRouting


.{devworkspace}

The {devworkspace} custom resource contains details about an {prod-short} workspace. Notably, it will contain devfile details and a reference to the editor definition.

.DevWorkspaceTemplate

In {prod-short} the DevWorkspaceTemplate custom resource is typically used to define an editor (such as Visual Studio Code) for {prod-short} workspaces. This custom resource can be used to define reusable `spec.template` content that is reused by multiple {devworkspace}s.

.DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig

The DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig (DWOC) custom resource defines configuration options for the DWO. There are two different types of DWOC, a global config and a non-global config.

The global config is a DWOC custom resource named `devworkspace-operator-config` and is expected to be located in the DWO installation namespace. By default, the global config is not created upon installation. Configuration fields set in the global configuration will apply to the DWO and all {devworkspace}s; however, the DWOC configuration can be overridden by a non-global config.

In contrast, any other DWOC custom resource not satisfying abovementioned criteria for global configuration is considered a non-global configuration. These non-global configurations will not apply to any {devworkspace}s unless the {devworkspace} contains a reference to them. When both a global and non-global configuration define the same fields, the non-global configuration's field will take precedence.

.Global DWOC and {prod-short}-owned DWOC comparison
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| |Global DWOC |{prod-short}-owned DWOC
|Resource name |`devworkspace-operator-config` |`devworkspace-config`
|Namespace |DWO installation namespace |{prod-short} installation namespace
|Default creation |Not created by default upon DWO installation |Created by default on {prod-short} installation
|Scope |Applies to the DWO itself and all {devworkspace}s managed by DWO |Applies to {devworkspace}s created by {prod-short}
|Precedence |Overridden by fields set in {prod-short}-owned config |Takes precedence over global config if both define the same field
|Primary use case |Used to define default, broad settings that apply to DWO in general. |Used to define specific configuration for {devworkspace}s created by {prod-short}
|===

For example, by default {prod-short} creates and manages a non-global DWOC in the {prod-short} namespace named `devworkspace-config`. This DWOC contains configuration specific to {prod-short} workspaces, and is maintained by {prod-short} depending on how you configure the CheCluster CR. When {prod-short} creates a workspace, {prod-short} adds a reference to the {prod-short}-owned DWOC with the `controller.devfile.io/devworkspace-config` attribute.

.DevWorkspaceRouting

The `DevWorkspaceRouting` custom resource defines details about the endpoints of a {devworkspace}. Every {devworkspace} will have its corresponding `DevWorkspaceRouting` object that specifies the workspace's container endpoints. Endpoints defined from the devfile, as well as endpoints defined by the editor definition will appear in the `DevWorkspaceRouting` custom resource.

.{devworkspace} Operator's operands

The {devworkspace} Operator has two operands, the controller deployment and the webhook deployment.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods -l 'app.kubernetes.io/part-of=devworkspace-operator' -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name -n openshift-operators
NAME
devworkspace-controller-manager-66c6f674f5-l7rhj <1>
devworkspace-webhook-server-d4958d9cd-gh7vr <2>
devworkspace-webhook-server-d4958d9cd-rfvj6 <2>
----

<1> The {devworkspace} controller pod, which is responsible for reconciling custom resources
<2> The {devworkspace} operator webhook server pods

=== Configuring the {devworkspace}-controller-manager deployment

The `devworkspace-controller-manager` pod can be configured in the {devworkspace} Operator Subscription object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: devworkspace-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  config:
    affinity:

      podAffinity: ...
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: ...
        cpu: ...
      requests:

        cpu: ...

More details on configuration can be found in this link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/subscription-config.md[documentation].

=== Configuring the {devworkspace}-webhook-server deployment

You can configure the `devworkspace-webhook-server` deployment in the global DWOC:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: controller.devfile.io/v1alpha1
kind: DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig
metadata:
  name: devworkspace-operator-config
  namespace: <DWO install namespace>
config:
