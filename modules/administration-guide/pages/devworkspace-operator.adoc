= {devworkspace} Operator overview


The {devworkspace} Operator (DWO) is a dependency of {prod-short}, and is an integral part of how {prod-short} functions. One of DWO's main responsibilities is to reconcile {devworkspace} custom resources (CR).

The {devworkspace} CR is a {orch-name} resource representation of a {prod-short} workspace. Whenever a user creates a workspace using the {prod-short} In the background, Dashboard {prod-short} creates a {devworkspace} CR in the cluster. For every {prod-short} workspace, there is an underlying {devworkspace} CR on the cluster.

Figure 1 shows an example of a {devworkspace} CR in a cluster:

When creating a workspace with {prod-short} with a devfile, the {devworkspace} CR contains the devfile details. Additionally, {prod-short} adds the editor definition into the {devworkspace} CR depending on which editor was chosen for the workspace. {prod-short} will also add attributes to the {devworkspace} which further configures the workspace depending on how you configured the `CheCluster` CR.

A `DevWorkspaceTemplate` is a custom resource that defines a reusable `spec.template` for {devworkspace}s.

When a workspace is started, DWO reads the corresponding {devworkspace} CR and creates a workspace pod running the container(s) defined in the devfile.

.Custom Resources overview

The following Custom Resource Definitions are provided by the {devworkspace} Operator:

* `{devworkspace}`
* `DevWorkspaceTemplate`
* `DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig`
* `DevWorkspaceRouting`


.{devworkspace}

The {devworkspace} custom resource contains details about an {prod-short} workspace. Notably, it contains devfile details and a reference to the editor definition.

.DevWorkspaceTemplate

In {prod-short} the `DevWorkspaceTemplate` custom resource is typically used to define an editor (such as Visual Studio Code - Open Source) for {prod-short} workspaces. You can use this custom resource to define reusable `spec.template` content that is reused by multiple {devworkspace}s.

.DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig

The `DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig` (DWOC) custom resource defines configuration options for the DWO. There are two different types of DWOC:

 * global configuration
 * non-global configuration

The global configuration is a DWOC custom resource named `devworkspace-operator-config` and is usually located in the DWO installation namespace. By default, the global configuration is not created upon installation. Configuration fields set in the global configuration will apply to the DWO and all {devworkspace}s. However, the DWOC configuration can be overridden by a non-global configuration.

Any other DWOC custom resource than `devworkspace-operator-config` is considered to be non-global configuration. A non-global configuration does not apply to any {devworkspace}s unless the {devworkspace} contains a reference to the DWOC. If the global configuration and non-global configuration have the same fields, the non-global configuration field takes precedence.

.Global DWOC and {prod-short}-owned DWOC comparison
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| |Global DWOC |{prod-short}-owned DWOC
|Resource name |`devworkspace-operator-config` |`devworkspace-config`
|Namespace |DWO installation namespace |{prod-short} installation namespace
|Default creation |Not created by default upon DWO installation |Created by default on {prod-short} installation
|Scope |Applies to the DWO itself and all {devworkspace}s managed by DWO |Applies to {devworkspace}s created by {prod-short}
|Precedence |Overridden by fields set in {prod-short}-owned config |Takes precedence over global config if both define the same field
|Primary use case |Used to define default, broad settings that apply to DWO in general. |Used to define specific configuration for {devworkspace}s created by {prod-short}
|===

For example, by default {prod-short} creates and manages a non-global DWOC in the {prod-short} namespace named `devworkspace-config`. This DWOC contains configuration specific to {prod-short} workspaces, and is maintained by {prod-short} depending on how you configure the CheCluster CR. When {prod-short} creates a workspace, {prod-short} adds a reference to the {prod-short}-owned DWOC with the `controller.devfile.io/devworkspace-config` attribute.

.DevWorkspaceRouting

The `DevWorkspaceRouting` custom resource defines details about the endpoints of a {devworkspace}. Every {devworkspace} has its corresponding `DevWorkspaceRouting` object that specifies the workspace's container endpoints. Endpoints defined from the devfile, as well as endpoints defined by the editor definition will appear in the `DevWorkspaceRouting` custom resource.

.{devworkspace} Operator's operands

The {devworkspace} Operator has two operands:

* controller deployment
* webhook deployment.

=== Configuring the {devworkspace}-controller-manager deployment

You can configure the `devworkspace-controller-manager` pod in the {devworkspace} Operator Subscription object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: devworkspace-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators

.Configuring the {devworkspace}-webhook-server deployment

You can configure the `devworkspace-webhook-server` deployment in the global DWOC:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: controller.devfile.io/v1alpha1
