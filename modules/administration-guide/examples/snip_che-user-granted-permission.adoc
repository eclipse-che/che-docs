====
Each user is granted permissions only to their namespace, and can not access other userâ€™s resources.
Cluster administrators can add extra permissions to users.
They should not remove permissions granted by default.

Refer to the link:https://eclipse.dev/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/configuring-cluster-roles-for-users/[product documentation] for configuring cluster roles for {prod} users.

More details about the role-based access control are available in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/authentication/using-rbac.html[OpenShift documentation].
