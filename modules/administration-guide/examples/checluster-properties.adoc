nonProxyHosts: List of hosts that will be reached directly, bypassing the proxy. Specify wild card domain use the following form `.<DOMAIN>` and `|` as delimiter, for example\: `localhost|.my.host.com|123.42.12.32` Only use when configuring a proxy is required. Operator respects OpenShift cluster wide proxy configuration and no additional configuration is required, but defining `nonProxyHosts` in a custom resource leads to merging non proxy hosts lists from the cluster proxy configuration and ones defined in the custom resources. See the doc https\://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html. See also the `proxyURL` fields.

proxyURL: URL (protocol+host name) of the proxy server. This drives the appropriate changes in the `JAVA_OPTS` and `https(s)_proxy` variables in the Che server and workspaces containers. Only use when configuring a proxy is required. Operator respects OpenShift cluster wide proxy configuration and no additional configuration is required, but defining `proxyUrl` in a custom resource leads to overrides the cluster proxy configuration with fields `proxyUrl`, `proxyPort`, `proxyUser` and `proxyPassword` from the custom resource. See the doc https\://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html. See also the `proxyPort` and `nonProxyHosts` fields.
proxyUser: User name of the proxy server. Only use when configuring a proxy is required. See also the `proxyURL`, `proxyPassword` and `proxySecret` fields.

serverExposureStrategy: Deprecated. The value of this flag is ignored. Sets the server and workspaces exposure type. Possible values are `multi-host`, `single-host`, `default-host`. Defaults to `multi-host`, which creates a separate ingress, or OpenShift routes, for every required endpoint. `single-host` makes Che exposed on a single host name with workspaces exposed on subpaths. Read the docs to learn about the limitations of this approach. Also consult the `singleHostExposureType` property to further configure how the Operator and the Che server make that happen on Kubernetes. `default-host` exposes the Che server on the host of the cluster. Read the docs to learn about the limitations of this approach.
serverMemoryLimit: Overrides the memory limit used in the Che server deployment. Defaults to 1Gi.
serverMemoryRequest: Overrides the memory request used in the Che server deployment. Defaults to 512Mi.
serverTrustStoreConfigMapName: Name of the ConfigMap with public certificates to add to Java trust store of the Che server. This is often required when adding the OpenShift OAuth provider, which has HTTPS endpoint signed with self-signed cert. The Che server must be aware of its CA cert to be able to request it. This is disabled by default. The Config Map must have `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=che.eclipse.org` label.
singleHostGatewayConfigMapLabels: The labels that need to be present in the ConfigMaps representing the gateway configuration.
singleHostGatewayConfigSidecarImage: The image used for the gateway sidecar that provides configuration to the gateway. Omit it or leave it empty to use the default container image provided by the Operator.

useInternalClusterSVCNames: Deprecated in favor of `disableInternalClusterSVCNames`.
workspaceNamespaceDefault: Defines Kubernetes default namespace in which user's workspaces are created for a case when a user does not override it. It's possible to use `<username>`, `<userid>` and `<workspaceid>` placeholders, such as che-workspace-<username>. In that case, a new namespace will be created for each user or workspace.
workspacePodNodeSelector: The node selector that limits the nodes that can run the workspace pods.
workspacePodTolerations: The pod tolerations put on the workspace pods to limit where the workspace pods can run.
workspacesDefaultPlugins: Default plug-ins applied to Devworkspaces.
