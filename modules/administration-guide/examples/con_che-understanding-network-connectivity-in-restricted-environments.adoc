= Understanding network connectivity in restricted environments

{prod-short} requires that each {platforms-ingress} created for {prod-short} is accessible from inside the {platforms-name} cluster.
These {prod-short} components have a {platforms-ingress}: `{prod-id-short}-server`, `{identity-provider-id}`, `devfile-registry`, `plugin-registry`.

Consider the network topology of the environment to determine how best to accomplish this. 

.Network owned by a company or an organization, disconnected from the public Internet
====
The network administrators must ensure that it is possible to route traffic bound from the cluster to {platforms-ingress} hostnames.
====

.Private subnetwork in a cloud provider
====
Create a proxy configuration allowing the traffic to leave the node to reach an external-facing Load Balancer.
