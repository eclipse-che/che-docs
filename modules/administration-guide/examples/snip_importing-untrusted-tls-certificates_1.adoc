. Save the certificates you need to import, to a local file system.

[CAUTION]
====
* Certificate files are typically stored as Base64 ASCII files, such as `.pem`, `.crt`, `.ca-bundle`. But, they can also be binary-encoded, for example, as `.cer` files. All Secrets that hold certificate files should use the Base64 ASCII certificate rather than the binary-encoded certificate.
* {prod-short} already uses some reserved file names to automatically inject certificates into the ConfigMap, so you should avoid using the following reserved file names to save your certificates:
  ** `ca-bundle.crt`
  ** `ca.crt`
