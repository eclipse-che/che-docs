= Grafana dashboards for the {devworkspace} operator

This section describes the example Grafana dashboard, see link:https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator/blob/main/docs/grafana/grafana-dashboard.json[grafana-dashboard.json], which displays metrics collected from the {devworkspace} operator.

.The *{devworkspace}-specific metrics* panel

The *{devworkspace}-specific metrics* panel contains information related to `DevWorkspace` startup.

Average workspace start time:: The average start time of a workspace.
Workspace starts:: The number successful and failed workspace starts.
Workspace startup duration:: A heatmap that displays workspace startup duration.
{devworkspace} successes / failures:: A comparison between successful and failed {devworkspace} startups
{devworkspace} failure rate:: The ratio between the number of failed workspace startups and the number of total workspace startups.
{devworkspace} startup failure reasons:: A pie chart that displays the distribution of workspace startup failures. The possible failure reasons are:
* `BadRequest`
* `InfrastructureFailure`
* `Unknown`

.The *Operator metrics* panel, part 1

Webhooks in flight:: A comparison between the number of different webhook requests.
Work queue duration:: A heatmap that displays how long the reconcile requests stay in the work queue before they are handled.
Webhooks latency (/mutate):: A heatmap that displays `/mutate` webhook latency.
Reconcile time:: A heatmap that displays the reconcile duration.

.The *Operator metrics* panel, part 2

Webhooks latency (/convert):: A heatmap that displays `/convert` webhook latency.
Work queue depth:: The number of reconcile requests that are in the work queue.
Memory:: Memory usage for the {devworkspace} controller and the {devworkspace} webhook server.
Reconcile counts (DWO):: The average per-second number of reconcile counts for the {devworkspace} controller.
