This section describes how to configure {prod-short} and related containers to use images in a restricted environment rather than the default images in an online registry.

.Prerequisites

* All required images available in an image registry that is accessible from the cluster where {prod-short} is to be deployed.

.Procedure

This procedure uses the following placeholders:

.Placeholders used in examples
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| `<my-internal-registry>`
| a hostname of the container-image registry, accessible in the restricted environment, see xref:preparing-a-restricted-environment.adoc[]

| `<my-organization>`
| organization of the container-image registry

| `<my-offline-plug-in-registry>`
| offline plug-in registry, see xref:preparing-a-restricted-environment.adoc[]

| `<my-offline-devfile-registry>`
| offline devfile registry, see xref:preparing-a-restricted-environment.adoc[]

| `<ver>`
| release of {prod-short} that is being deployed
|===

The `CheCluster` Custom Resource, which is managed by the {prod-short} Operator, includes fields to facilitate deploying an instance of {prod-short} in a restricted environment:

[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
# ...
spec:
  server:
    airGapContainerRegistryHostname: '__<my-internal-registry>__'
    airGapContainerRegistryOrganization: '__<my-organization>__'
# ...
----

Setting these values uses `<my-internal-registry>` and `<my-organization>` for all images. This means that the Operator expects the offline plug-in and devfile registries to be available at:

[subs="+quotes"]
----
__<my-internal-registry>__/__<my-organization>__/__<my-offline-plug-in-registry>__:__<ver>__
__<my-internal-registry>__/__<my-organization>__/__<my-offline-devfile-registry>__:__<ver>__
