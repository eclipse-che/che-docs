If your organization is already running a {prod-short} instance, you can get started as a new user of {prod-short} by first learning how to start a new workspace and how to manage your workspaces:

. xref:starting-a-new-workspace-with-a-clone-of-a-git-repository.adoc[]
. xref:optional-parameters-for-the-urls-for-starting-a-new-workspace.adoc[]
. xref:basic-actions-you-can-perform-on-a-workspace.adoc[]

Beyond this, your organization has its own setup and onboarding needs regarding:

* Specific Git repositories
* Devfiles that are stored in specific Git repositories and that set workspace configuration
* {prod-short} related instructions in the READMEs
* Team-level processes and procedures
