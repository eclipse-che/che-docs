= Starting a workspace from a Git repository URL

With {prod-short}, you can use a URL in your browser to start
a new workspace that contains a clone of a Git repository.
This way, you can clone a Git repository that is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket or Microsoft Azure DevOps server instances.

TIP: You can also use the *Git Repository URL* field on the *Create Workspace* page of your {prod-short} dashboard to enter the URL of a Git repository to start a new workspace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* If you use an SSH URL to start a new workspace, you must propagate the SSH key. See link:https://github.com/devfile/devworkspace-operator/blob/main/docs/additional-configuration.adoc#configuring-devworkspaces-to-use-ssh-keys-for-git-operations[Configuring DevWorkspaces to use SSH keys for Git operations] for more information.
* If the SSH URL points to a private repository, you must apply an access token to be able to fetch the `devfile.yaml` content. You can do this either by accepting an SCM authentication page or following a xref:using-a-git-provider-access-token.adoc[Personal Access Token] procedure.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Configure personal access token to access private repositories. See xref:using-a-git-provider-access-token.adoc[].
====

.Prerequisites

* Your organization has a running instance of {prod-short}.
* You know the FQDN URL of your organization's {prod-short} instance: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]`.
* Optional: You have xref:authenticating-to-a-git-server-from-a-workspace.adoc[authentication to the Git server] configured.
* Your Git repository maintainer keeps the `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` file in the root directory of the Git repository. (For alternative file names and file paths, see xref:optional-parameters-for-the-urls-for-starting-a-new-workspace.adoc[].)
+
TIP: You can also start a new workspace by supplying the URL of a Git repository that contains no devfile. Doing so results in a workspace with Universal Developer Image and with Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source as the workspace IDE.
//provide a link to a page about the Universal Developer Image similar to https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi for UBI and, if applicable, devfile-less defaults for new workspaces. max-cx

.Procedure

To start a new workspace with a clone of a Git repository:

. Optional: Visit your {prod-short} dashboard pages to authenticate to your organization's instance of {prod-short}.

. Visit the URL to start a new workspace using the basic syntax:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
+
----
pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]#__<git_repository_url>__
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can extend this URL with optional parameters:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]#__<git_repository_url>__?__<optional_parameters>__ <1>
----
<1> See xref:optional-parameters-for-the-urls-for-starting-a-new-workspace.adoc[].

[TIP]
====
You can use Git+SSH URLs to start a new workspace.

.A URL for starting a new workspace
====
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://github.com/che-samples/cpp-hello-world]`
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#git@github.com:che-samples/cpp-hello-world.git]`
====

+
.The URL syntax for starting a new workspace with a clone of a GitHub instance repository
====

* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<github_host>__/__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the default branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<github_host>__/__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__/tree/__<branch_name>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the specified branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<github_host>__/__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__/pull/__<pull_request_id>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the branch of the pull request.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#git@__<github_host>__:__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__.git]` starts a new workspace from Git+SSH URL.
====

+
.The URL syntax for starting a new workspace with a clone of a GitLab instance repository
====

* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<gitlab_host>__/__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the default branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<gitlab_host>__/__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__/-/tree/__<branch_name>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the specified branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#git@__<gitlab_host>__:__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__.git]` starts a new workspace from Git+SSH URL.
====

+
.The URL syntax for starting a new workspace with a clone of a BitBucket Server repository
====

* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<bb_host>__/scm/__<project-key>__/__<repository>__.git]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the default branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<bb_host>__/users/__<user_slug>__/repos/__<repository>__/]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the default branch, if a repository was created under the user profile.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<bb_host>__/users/__<user-slug>__/repos/__<repository>__/browse?at=refs%2Fheads%2F__<branch-name>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the specified branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#git@__<bb_host>__:__<user_slug>__/__<repository>__.git]` starts a new workspace from Git+SSH URL.

====
+
.The URL syntax for starting a new workspace with a clone of a Microsoft Azure DevOps Git repository
====
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<organization>__@dev.azure.com/__<organization>__/__<project>__/_git/__<repository>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the default branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://__<organization>__@dev.azure.com/__<organization>__/__<project>__/_git/__<repository>__?version=GB__<branch>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the specific branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/__<organization>__/__<project>__/__<repository>__]` starts a new workspace from Git+SSH URL.
====

+
After you enter the URL to start a new workspace in a browser tab, the workspace starting page appears.
+
When the new workspace is ready, the workspace IDE loads in the browser tab.
+
A clone of the Git repository is present in the filesystem of the new workspace.
+
The workspace has a unique URL: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]/__<user_name>__/__<unique_url>__`.
