= Maintaining a Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension list in the devfile

If you can't add configuration files to your source code repository, configure your workspace devfile to enable Microsoft Visual Studio Code to automatically install workspace recommended extensions.

.Prerequisites
* You can't add configuration files to your source code repository. xref:maintaining-a-microsoft-visual-studio-code-extension-list.adoc[] is not possible.

* {prod-short} has access to the link:https://www.open-vsx.org/[OpenVSX registry].
+
[TIP]
====
To install recommended extensions in a restricted environment, consider these options:

* xref:administration-guide:configuring-the-open-vsx-registry-url.adoc[] to point to your OpenVSX registry.

* xref:selecting-an-in-browser-ide-for-all-workspaces-that-clone-the-same-git-repository.adoc[] that accesses an internal plugin registry, such as Che-Theia.

* link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix[Installing extensions from VSX files].
====

.Procedure
. Go to the link:https://www.open-vsx.org/[Open VSX registry], search for extensions, and on each extension description page, collect the extension unique identifier.

* __<publisher_id_2>__.__<extension_id_2>__
