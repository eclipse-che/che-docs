= Developer workspaces

{prod} provides developer workspaces with everything you need to code, build, test, run, and debug applications:

* Project source code
* Web-based integrated development environment (IDE)
* Tool dependencies needed by developers to work on a project
* Application runtime: a replica of the environment where the application runs in production

Pods manage each component of a {prod-short} workspace. Therefore, everything running in a {prod-short} workspace is running inside containers. This makes a {prod-short} workspace highly portable.

The embedded browser-based IDE is the point of access for everything running in a {prod-short} workspace. This makes a {prod-short} workspace easy to share.

Typical use cases:

* xref:first-time-contributors.adoc[]
* xref:benefits-of-pull-requests-review-in-che.adoc[]
