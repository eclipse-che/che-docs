= Authentication for Git repositories

Setting up authentication to a Git server with your GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket account removes the need to provide your Git credentials to `git` when performing operations such as cloning private repositories and pushing to remote repositories.

To provide your Git credentials to your {devworkspace}s, you can:

* Follow the xref:git-credential-store.adoc[] guide to create a Git credentials secret to be mounted to the {devworkspace} containers.

* Or, have your administrator set up an OAuth application for your organization's {prod} instance. This is the recommended method. See xref:administration-guide:oauth-for-github-gitlab-or-bitbucket.adoc[]. If the OAuth application is set up by the administrator, the Git credentials Secret described in xref:git-credential-store.adoc[] is created automatically when you create a {devworkspace} with a private repository.
