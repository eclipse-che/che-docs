= Developer workspaces

{prod} provides developer workspaces with everything you need to code, build, test, run, and debug applications:

* Project source code
* Web-based integrated development environment (IDE)
* Tool dependencies needed by developers to work on a project
* Application runtime: a replica of the environment where the application runs in production

Pods manage each component of a {prod-short} workspace.
Therefore, everything running in a {prod-short} workspace is running inside containers.
This makes a {prod-short} workspace highly portable.

The embedded browser-based IDE is the point of access for everything running in a {prod-short} workspace.

== Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source

Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source is the default browser-based IDE.

{prod-short} adds these extensions:

Commands::
Translates Devfile commands to Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source tasks.
+
.Procedure
* To see the drop-down list of available tasks, type: kbd:[F1] `Tasks: Run Task` kbd:[Enter] `che`.

Activity tracker::
Tracks events provided by the Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source to determine and stop inactive workspaces.
This extension does not save, collect, or store data.

API::
Provides helpers to interact with {devworkspace} and {prod-short}.

GitHub authentication::
Provides support for authenticating to GitHub.
It registers the `github` Authentication Provider that can be leveraged by other extensions.
This also provides the GitHub authentication used by Settings Sync.

Port::
Detects opening ports and provides redirect URI.
When a process starts listening to a port, {prod-short} displays a notification with a link to open the resulting resource.
+
.Procedure
* To display the endpoint list, type: kbd:[F1] `Explorer: Focus on endpoints View` kbd:[Enter].

Remote::
Provides commands for the remote authority.

Resource monitor::
Monitors resources such as CPU and RAM.

Telemetry::
Detects and sends the following events to a backend telemetry plugin listening on `\http://localhost:$\{DEVWORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT}`:

`WORKSPACE_OPENED`:::
Sent when the telemetry extension activates

`EDITOR_USED`:::
Sent on the `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument` event

Terminal::
Opens a terminal to a {devworkspace} container.
