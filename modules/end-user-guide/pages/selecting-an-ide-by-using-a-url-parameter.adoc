= Selecting an in-browser IDE for one new workspace

You can select your preferred in-browser IDE when using a URL for starting a new workspace. This way, each developer using {prod-short} can start a workspace with a clone of the same project repository and yet with the personal choice of the in-browser IDE.

.Procedure

. Include the URL parameter for the workspace IDE in the URL for starting a new workspace. See xref:url-parameter-for-the-workspace-ide.adoc[].
. Visit the URL in the browser. See xref:starting-a-new-workspace-with-a-clone-of-a-git-repository.adoc[].
. Verify that the selected in-browser IDE loads in the browser tab of the started workspace.
