= Automatic {orch-name} token injection

This section describes how to use the {orch-name} user token that is automatically injected into workspace containers which allows running {prod-short} CLI commands against {orch-name} cluster.

.Procedure

. Open the {prod-short} dashboard and start a workspace.

. Once the workspace is started, open a terminal in the container that contains the {prod-short} CLI.

. Execute {prod-short} CLI commands which allow you to run commands against {orch-name} cluster. CLI can be used for deploying applications, inspecting and managing cluster resources, and viewing logs. {orch-name} user token will be used during the execution of the commands.
