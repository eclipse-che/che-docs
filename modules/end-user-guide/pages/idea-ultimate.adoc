.Connecting JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition to an existing workspace

There are two options to connect the local IntelliJ IDE to an existing workspace:

* from the Che Dashboard
* from the Gateway application

The simplest way to connect to an existing workspace is to start a workspace from the {prod-short} Dashboard and click the `Open Gateway` button.
However, with the Gateway application, you can connect the IntelliJ IDE to your workspace without accessing the {prod-short} Dashboard.

.Procedure

. Open the Gateway app and click `Connect to Dev Spaces`:
