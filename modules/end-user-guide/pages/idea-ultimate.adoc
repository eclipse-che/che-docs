= JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (over JetBrains Gateway)

{prod} supports connecting your local IntelliJ IDE to a running {prod-short} workspace over JetBrains Gateway.

.Prerequisites

. Install the JetBrains Gateway application from https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/

. Install the Gateway provider for OpenShift Dev Spaces from https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24234-openshift-dev-spaces

. In your local terminal, log in to your OpenShift server with the OpenShift Client. `oc login` command establishes the authenticated session and saves the connection information to the configuration file which is read by the Gateway provider for OpenShift Dev Spaces.

.Procedure of connecting to a new workspace

. When creating your workspace on Che Dashboard, choose `IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (desktop)` editor:

. Once the workspace runs, the Dashboard will ask if you want to open your local JetBrains Gateway application:

Clicking the `Open Gateway` button will start your local JetBrains Client application connected to your Dev Spaces workspace:

.Procedure of connecting to an existing workspace

There are two options to connect to an already existing workspace:

* from the Che Dashboard
* from the Gateway application

The simplest way to connect to an existing workspace is to start a workspace from the Che Dashboard and click the `Open Gateway` button.
Another option to connect is using the Gateway application. It allows connecting without accessing the Che Dashboard.

. Open the Gateway app and click `Connect to Dev Spaces`:
