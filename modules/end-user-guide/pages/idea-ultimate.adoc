= Connecting JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition to a {prod-short} workspace

[IMPORTANT]
====
Integration with the link:https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/[JetBrains Gateway] is currently implemented only for x86 {orch-name} clusters.
====

{prod} supports connecting your local IntelliJ IDE to a running {prod-short} workspace over JetBrains Gateway.

.Prerequisites

. link:https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/[The JetBrains Gateway application] is installed.

. link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24234-openshift-dev-spaces[The Gateway provider for OpenShift Dev Spaces] is installed.

. In your local terminal, you are logged in to your OpenShift server with the OpenShift Client.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `oc login` command establishes the authenticated session and saves the connection information to the configuration file which is read by the Gateway provider for OpenShift Dev Spaces.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
In addition to the recommendations about calculating xref:administration-guide:calculating-che-resource-requirements.adoc[memory and CPU], make sure you have enough empty storage space to download and unpack the JetBrains IDE. For reference, CLion IDE, which is the largest of the IDEs, requires approximately 8.5 GB of disk space.

.Connecting JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition to an existing workspace

There are two options to connect the local IntelliJ IDE to an existing workspace:

* from the Che Dashboard
* from the Gateway application

The simplest way to connect to an existing workspace is to start a workspace from the {prod-short} Dashboard and click the `Open Gateway` button.
However, with the Gateway application, you can connect the IntelliJ IDE to your workspace without accessing the {prod-short} Dashboard.

.Procedure

. Open the Gateway app and click `Connect to Dev Spaces`:

. Choose your workspace and click the `Connect` button:
