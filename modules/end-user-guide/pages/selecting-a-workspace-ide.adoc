= Selecting a workspace IDE

The default in-browser IDE in a new workspace is Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source.

You can select another supported in-browser IDE by either method:

* When you start a new workspace by visiting a URL, you can choose an IDE for that workspace by adding the `che-editor` parameter to the URL. See xref:selecting-an-in-browser-ide-for-one-new-workspace.adoc[].
* You can specify an IDE in the `.che/che-editor.yaml` file of the Git repository for all new workspaces that will feature a clone of that repository. See xref:selecting-an-in-browser-ide-for-all-workspaces-that-clone-the-same-git-repository.adoc[].
