= Selecting a workspace IDE

The default in-browser IDE in a new workspace is link:https://github.com/che-incubator/che-code[Visual Studio Code]. In addition, link:https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images[JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm] are available as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview] feature. link:https://theia-ide.org/docs/[Che Theia] is available as well but is planned to be removed in next releases.

You can select another supported in-browser IDE by either method:

* When you start a new workspace by visiting a URL, you can choose an IDE for that workspace by adding the `che-editor` parameter to the URL. See xref:selecting-an-in-browser-ide-for-one-new-workspace.adoc[].
* You can specify an IDE in the `.che/che-editor.yaml` file of the Git repository for all new workspaces that will feature a clone of that repository. See xref:selecting-an-in-browser-ide-for-all-workspaces-that-clone-the-same-git-repository.adoc[].
