= Starting a new workspace with a clone of a Git repository

Working with {prod-short} in your browser involves multiple URLs:

* The URL of your organization's {prod-short} instance, used as part of all the following URLs
* The URL of the *Workspaces* page of your {prod-short} dashboard with the workspace control panel
* [.underline]#The URLs for starting a new workspace#
* The URLs of your workspaces in use

With {prod-short}, you can visit a URL in your browser to start a new workspace that contains a clone of a Git repository. This way, you can clone a Git repository that is hosted on GitHub, a GitLab instance, or a Bitbucket server.

TIP: You can also use the *Git Repo URL ** field on the *Create Workspace* page of your {prod-short} dashboard to enter the URL of a Git repository to start a new workspace.

.Prerequisites

* Your organization has a running instance of {prod-short}.
* You know the FQDN URL of your organization's {prod-short} instance: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]`.
* Optional: You have xref:authenticating-to-a-git-server-from-a-workspace.adoc[authentication to the Git server] configured.
* Your Git repository maintainer keeps the `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` file in the root directory of the Git repository. (For alternative file names and file paths, see xref:optional-parameters-for-the-urls-for-starting-a-new-workspace.adoc[].)
+
TIP: You can also start a new workspace by supplying the URL of a Git repository that contains no devfile. Doing so results in a workspace with Universal Developer Image and with Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source as the workspace IDE.
//provide a link to a page about the Universal Developer Image similar to https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi for UBI and, if applicable, devfile-less defaults for new workspaces. max-cx

.Procedure

To start a new workspace with a clone of a Git repository:

. Optional: Visit your {prod-short} dashboard pages to authenticate to your organization's instance of {prod-short}.

. Visit the URL to start a new workspace using the basic syntax:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
+
----
pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]#__<git_repository_url>__
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can extend this URL with optional parameters:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]#__<git_repository_url>__?__<optional_parameters>__ <1>
----
<1> See xref:optional-parameters-for-the-urls-for-starting-a-new-workspace.adoc[].

====

With GitHub and GitLab, you can even use the URL of a specific branch of the repository to be cloned:

* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://github.com/__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the default branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://github.com/__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__/tree/__<branch_name>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the specified branch.
* `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://github.com/__<user_or_org>__/__<repository>__/pull/__<pull_request_id>__]` starts a new workspace with a clone of the branch of the pull request.
====
+
After you enter the URL to start a new workspace in a browser tab, it renders the workspace-starting page.
+
When the new workspace is ready, the workspace IDE loads in the browser tab.
+
A clone of the Git repository is present in the filesystem of the new workspace.
+
The workspace has a unique URL: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]#workspace__<unique_url>__`.

[TIP]
====
Although this is not possible in the address bar, you can add a URL for starting a new workspace as a bookmark by using the browser bookmark manager:

* In Mozilla Firefox, go to *☰* *>* *Bookmarks* *>* *Manage bookmarks Ctrl+Shift+O* *>* *Bookmarks Toolbar* *>* *Organize* *>* *Add bookmark*.

* In Google Chrome, go to *⋮* *>* *Bookmarks* *>* *Bookmark manager* *>* *Bookmarks bar* *>* *⋮* *>* *Add new bookmark*.
