{prod} workspace contains all tools you need to review pull and merge requests from start to finish. By clicking a {prod-short} link, you get access to {prod}-supported web IDE with a ready-to-use workspace where you can run a linter, unit tests, the build and more.

* You use a {prod}-supported browser: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

. Check the pull or merge request changes.
. Run your desired debugging and testing tools:
** Run a linter.
** Run unit tests.
** Run the build.
** Run the application to check for problems.
