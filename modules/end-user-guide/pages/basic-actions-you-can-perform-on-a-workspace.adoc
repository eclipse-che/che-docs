= Basic actions you can perform on a workspace

You manage your workspaces and verify their current states in the *Workspaces* page (`{prod-url}/dashboard/#/workspaces`) of your {prod-short} dashboard.

After you start a new workspace, you can perform the following actions on it in the *Workspaces* page:

.Basic actions you can perform on a workspace
|===
| Action | GUI steps in the Workspaces page

| _Reopen a running workspace_
| Click *Open*.

| _Restart a running workspace_
| Go to *⋮* *>* *Restart Workspace*.

| _Stop a running workspace_
| Go to *⋮* *>* *Stop Workspace*.

| _Start a stopped workspace_
| Click *Open*.

| _Delete a workspace_
| Go to *⋮* *>* *Delete Workspace*.

|===

IMPORTANT: When you stop a workspace, its state at the moment you stopped it is preserved until you restart it. And if you do not stop a running workspace manually, it stops automatically when it reaches an idle timeout limit or a running timeout limit, which are set by the administrator of your organization's {prod-short} instance. When the workspace stops automatically because of a timeout limit, its latest state is preserved until you restart it.
