== Supported IDEs

The default IDE in a new workspace is Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source. Alternatively, you can choose another supported IDE:

== Repository-level IDE configuration in {prod-short}

You can store IDE configuration files directly in the remote Git repository that contains your project source code and that will be cloned for a new workspace. This way, one common IDE configuration will be applied to all new workspaces that will feature a clone of that repository. Such IDE configuration files might include the following:

* xref:defining-a-common-ide.adoc[The `/.che/che-editor.yaml` file] that stores a definition of the chosen IDE.

* IDE-specific configuration files that one would typically store locally for a desktop IDE. For example, xref:microsoft-visual-studio-code-open-source-ide.adoc[the `/.vscode/extensions.json` file.]
