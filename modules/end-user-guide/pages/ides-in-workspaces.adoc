== Repository-level IDE configuration in {prod-short}

You can store IDE configuration files directly in the remote Git repository that contains your project source code. This way, one common IDE configuration is applied to all new workspaces that feature a clone of that repository. Such IDE configuration files might include the following:

* xref:defining-a-common-ide.adoc[The /.che/che-editor.yaml file] that stores a definition of the chosen IDE.

* IDE-specific configuration files that one would typically store locally for a desktop IDE. For example, xref:microsoft-visual-studio-code-open-source-ide.adoc[the /.vscode/extensions.json file.]
