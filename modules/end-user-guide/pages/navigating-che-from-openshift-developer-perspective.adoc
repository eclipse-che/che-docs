= Navigating {prod-short} from OpenShift Developer Perspective


The OpenShift Container Platform web console provides two perspectives; the *Administrator* perspective and the *Developer* perspective.

The Developer perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:

* Create and deploy applications on the OpenShift Container Platform by importing existing codebases, images, and Dockerfiles.

* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.

* Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.

* Integrate serverless capabilities (Technology Preview).

* Create workspaces to edit your application code using {prod-short}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting with {ocp} 4.19, the perspectives in the web console have unified to simplify navigation, reduce context switching, streamline tasks, and provide users with a more cohesive {ocp} experience.

With this unified design, there is no longer a *Developer* perspective in the default view; however, _all_ {ocp} web console features are discoverable to all users. If you are not the cluster owner, you might need to request permission for certain features from the cluster owner. The *Developer* perspective can still be manually enabled if you prefer.

The *Getting Started* pane in the web console provides resources such as, a tour of the console, information on setting up your cluster, a quick start for enabling the *Developer* perspective, and links to explore new features and capabilities.

//See xref:../web_console/web-console-overview#enabling-developer-perspective_web-console_web-console-overview for more information on enabling the *Developer* perspective.
