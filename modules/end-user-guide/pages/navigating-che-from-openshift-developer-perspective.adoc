The OpenShift Container Platform web console provides two perspectives; the *Administrator* perspective and the *Developer* perspective.

The Developer perspective provides workflows specific to developer use cases, such as the ability to:

* Create and deploy applications on the OpenShift Container Platform by importing existing codebases, images, and Dockerfiles.

* Visually interact with applications, components, and services associated with them within a project and monitor their deployment and build status.

* Group components within an application and connect the components within and across applications.

* Integrate serverless capabilities (Technology Preview).

* Create workspaces to edit your application code using {prod-short}.
