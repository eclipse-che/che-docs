= Starting a new workspace from a devfile URL

Working with {prod-short} in your browser involves multiple URLs:

* The URL of your organization's {prod-short} instance, used as part of all the following URLs
* The URL of the *devfile*
* [.underline]#The URLs for starting a new workspace#
* The URLs of your workspaces in use

With {prod-short}, you can open a *devfile* URL in your browser to start a new workspace.

pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = NO -->]

TIP: You can also use the *Git Repo URL ** field on the *Create Workspace* page of your {prod-short} dashboard to enter the URL of a *devfile* to start a new workspace.

pass:[<!-- vale RedHat.Spelling = YES -->]

.Prerequisites

* Your organization has a running instance of {prod-short}.
* You know the FQDN URL of your organization's {prod-short} instance: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]`.

.Procedure

To start a new workspace from a devfile URL:

. Optional: Visit your {prod-short} dashboard pages to authenticate to your organization's instance of {prod-short}.

. Visit the URL to start a new workspace using the basic syntax:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
+
----
pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]#__<devfile_url>__
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can extend this URL with optional parameters:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]#__<devfile_url>__?__<optional_parameters>__ <1>
----
<1> See xref:optional-parameters-for-the-urls-for-starting-a-new-workspace.adoc[].

.A URL for starting a new workspace
====

`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/che-samples/cpp-hello-world/main/devfile.yaml]`

====
+
[TIP]
====
You can pass your Personal Access Token to the URL to have access to private repositories:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]#__https://__<token>__@__<host>__/__<path> <1>
----
<1> Your Personal Access Token that you generated on the Git provider's website.

This works for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Microsoft Azure, and other providers that support Personal Access Token.
====
+
.Verification

After you enter the URL to start a new workspace in a browser tab, it renders the workspace-starting page. When the new workspace is ready, the workspace IDE loads in the browser tab. 

The workspace has a unique URL: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]#workspace__<unique_url>__`.

[TIP]
====
You can not bookmark a URL for starting a new workspace in the address bar, but you can create the bookmark by using the browser bookmark manager instead:

* In Mozilla Firefox, go to *☰* *>* *Bookmarks* *>* *Manage bookmarks Ctrl+Shift+O* *>* *Bookmarks Toolbar* *>* *Organize* *>* *Add bookmark*.

* In Google Chrome, go to *⋮* *>* *Bookmarks* *>* *Bookmark manager* *>* *Bookmarks bar* *>* *⋮* *>* *Add new bookmark*.
====
[IMPORTANT]
====
To initiate a clone of the Git repository in the filesystem of the new workspace, the devfile must contain project info.

See https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/adding-projects.
