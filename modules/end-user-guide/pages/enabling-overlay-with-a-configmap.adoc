= Enabling fuse-overlayfs with a Configmap

You can define the storage driver for Podman and Buildah in the `~/.config/containers/storage.conf` file. Here are the default contents of the `/home/user/.config/containers/storage.conf` file in the UDI container:

.`storage.conf`
[source]
----
[storage]
driver = "vfs"
----

To use fuse-overlayfs, `storage.conf` can be set to the following:

.`storage.conf`
[source]
----
[storage]
driver = "overlay"

[storage.options.overlay]
mount_program="/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs" <1>
----
<1> The absolute path to the `fuse-overlayfs` binary. The `/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs` path is the default for the UDI.

You can do this manually after starting a workspace. Another option is to build a new image based on the UDI with changes to `storage.conf` and use the new image for workspaces.

Otherwise, you can update the `/home/user/.config/containers/storage.conf` for all workspaces in your {orch-namespace} by creating a ConfigMap that mounts the updated file. See xref:mounting-configmaps.adoc[].

.Prerequisites

* For OpenShift versions older than 4.15, the administrator has enabled access to `/dev/fuse` by following xref:administration-guide:configuring-fuse.adoc[].

* A workspace with the required annotations are set by following xref:accessing-fuse.adoc[]


[NOTE]
====
Since ConfigMaps mounted by following xref:mounting-configmaps.adoc[this guide] mounts the ConfigMap's data to all workspaces, following this procedure will set the storage driver to fuse-overlayfs for all workspaces. Ensure that your workspaces contain the required annotations to use fuse-overlayfs by following xref:accessing-fuse.adoc[].
====

.Procedure

. Apply a ConfigMap that mounts a `/home/user/.config/containers/storage.conf` file in your {orch-namespace}.
