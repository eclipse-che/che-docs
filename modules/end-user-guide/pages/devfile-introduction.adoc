= Introduction to devfile in {prod}

link:https://devfile.io/[Devfiles] are `yaml` text files used for development environment customization. Use them to configure a devfile to suit your specific needs and share the customized devfile across multiple workspaces to ensure identical user experience and build, run, and deploy behaviours across your team.

.{prod}-specific devfile features

.Devfile and Universal Developer Image

You do not need a devfile to start a workspace. If you do not include a devfile in your project repository, {prod} automatically loads a default devfile with a Universal Developer Image (UDI).

.{prod-short} devfile registry

link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-devfile-registry[{prod-short} devfile registry] contains ready-to-use devfiles for different languages and technologies.
 
[NOTE]
====
Devfiles included in the registry are specific to {prod} and should be treated as samples rather than templates. They might require updates to work with other versions of the components featured in the samples.
