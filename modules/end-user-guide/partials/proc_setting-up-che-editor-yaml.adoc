= Setting up che-editor.yaml

By using the `che-editor.yaml` file, you can set a common default IDE for your team and provide new contributors with the most suitable IDE for your project source code. You can also use the `che-editor.yaml` file when you need to set a different cloud IDE default for a particular project repository rather than the default cloud IDE of your organization's {prod-short} instance.

.Procedure

* In the remote Git repository of your project, create a `/.che/che-editor.yaml` file with lines that specify the relevant parameter, as described in the next section.

.Verification

. xref:starting-a-new-workspace-with-a-clone-of-a-git-repository.adoc[Start a new workspace with a clone of the Git repository].
. Verify that the expected IDE loads in the browser tab of the started workspace.
