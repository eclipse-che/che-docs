= Setting up che-editor.yaml

By using the `che-editor.yaml` file, you can set a common default IDE for your team and provide new contributors with the most suitable IDE for your project source code. You can also use the `che-editor.yaml` file when you need to set a different IDE default for a particular source code Git repository rather than the default IDE of your organization's {prod-short} instance.

.Procedure

* In the remote Git repository of your project source code, create a `/.che/che-editor.yaml` file with lines that specify the relevant parameter.

.Verification

. xref:starting-a-workspace-from-a-git-repository-url.adoc[Start a new workspace with a clone of the Git repository].
. Verify that the specified IDE loads in the browser tab of the started workspace.
