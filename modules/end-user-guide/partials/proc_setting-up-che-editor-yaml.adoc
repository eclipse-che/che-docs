= Setting up che-editor.yaml

To define the same in-browser IDE for all workspaces that will clone the same remote Git repository of your project, you can use the `che-editor.yaml` file. Using this file allows you to set a common default editor for your team and to provide new contributors with a default editor that is most suitable for your project.

.Prerequisites

* The IDE `id` from the table in xref:selecting-a-workspace-ide.adoc[].

.Procedure

* In the remote Git repository of your project, create a `/.che/che-editor.yaml` file that specifies the `id` of your selected IDE. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
id: che-incubator/che-idea/latest
----

.Verification

. Visit the xref:starting-a-new-workspace-with-a-clone-of-a-git-repository.adoc[URL for starting a new workspace].
. Verify that the selected in-browser IDE loads in the browser tab of the started workspace.
