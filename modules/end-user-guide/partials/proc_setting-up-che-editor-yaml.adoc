= Setting up che-editor.yaml

To define the same in-browser IDE for all workspaces that will clone the same remote Git repository of your project, you can use the `che-editor.yaml` file.

This way, you can set a common default editor for your team and provide new contributors with the most suitable editor for your project. You can also use the `che-editor.yaml` file when you need to set a different IDE default for a particular project repository rather than the default IDE of your organization's {prod-short} instance.

.Procedure

* In the remote Git repository of your project, create a `/.che/che-editor.yaml` file with lines that specify the relevant parameter, as described in the next section.

.Verification

. Visit the xref:starting-a-new-workspace-with-a-clone-of-a-git-repository.adoc[URL for starting a new workspace].
. Verify that the selected in-browser IDE loads in the browser tab of the started workspace.
