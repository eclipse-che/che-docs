= Importing the source code of a project into a workspace

:context: importing-the-source-code-of-a-project-into-a-workspace

With {prod-short}, you can import and work on a project's current codebase in a workspace.

You can import a project's codebase into a workspace by using any of the following options:

* xref:creating-a-custom-workspace-from-the-dashboard_{context}[]
* xref:importing-from-the-dashboard-into-an-existing-workspace_{context}[]
* xref:importing-to-a-running-workspace-using-the-git-clone-command_{context}[]
* xref:importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}[]

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. See xref:installation-guide:installing-che.adoc[].

* A configured workspace with plug-ins related to your development environment defined on this instance of {prod}. See xref:configuring-a-workspace-with-dashboard.adoc[].

== Importing a project when creating a workspace

You can import a project's codebase while creating a new workspace: by using a devfile template and the project's URL.

.Procedure

. Go to the xref:navigating-che-using-the-dashboard.adoc[Dashboard] of {prod-short}.

. In the left navigation panel, click btn:[Create Workspace].

. Go to the *Custom Workspace* tab.

. Enter a workspace name.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not enter a *Workspace Name* for your workspace, {prod-short} generates a unique name for a new workspace from the devfile's `metadata.generateName` property followed by four random characters.
====

. Select a devfile template from the drop-down list.
+

=== Adding commands to an imported project
//Is this section only relevant as a subsection here or does it also apply to the other sections in this file? If the latter, consider promoting it to the next heading level. In any case, not checked by me, max-cx

You can add commands to a project that will enable running, debugging, or starting an application in a browser.

.Prerequisites

* A workspace with a project in it

.Procedure

. Go to the xref:navigating-che-using-the-dashboard.adoc[Dashboard] of {prod-short}.

. Under *RECENT WORKSPACES*, hover over the name of the workspace to which you will import the project.

. Click the three dots next to the workspace name.

. Select *Edit Workspace*.

. In the *Devfile* tab, edit the `commands` section of the devfile in the editor on the page.

. Click btn:[Save].

. Open the workspace.

. To run a command, select *Terminal* > *Run Task* from the main menu.

== Importing a project with *Git: Clone* in the GUI

You can import a project's codebase into a running workspace with the *Git: Clone* command in the graphic user interface of {prod-short}.
 
.Prerequisites
* A started workspace

.Procedure

. Select the *Git: Clone* command on the *Welcome* screen or from the command palette:
* On the *Welcome* screen, click the *Git: Clone* link.

[id="importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}"]
== Importing a project with the Git clone command in a terminal

You can use the command line to import a project's codebase into a running workspace.

.Prerequisites
* A running workspace

.Procedure

. Open a terminal inside the running workspace.

. Type the `git clone` command to pull code.
+

[NOTE]
====
Importing or deleting workspace projects in the terminal does not update the workspace configuration, and the IDE does not reflect the changes in the *Devfile* tab in the dashboard.

Similarly, when you add a project in the *Dashboard* and then delete the project with the `rm -fr myproject` command, the project may still appear in the *Devfile* tab.
