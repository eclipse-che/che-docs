= Creating a workspace from a feature branch of a Git repository

A {prod-short} workspace can be created by pointing to devfile that is stored in a Git source repository on a feature branch of the user’s choice. The {prod-short} instance then uses the discovered devfile to build a workspace.

.Prerequisites
* A running instance of {prod}. To install an instance of {prod}, see xref:installation-guide:installing-che.adoc[].
* The `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` file is located in the root folder of a Git repository, on a specific branch of the user's choice that is accessible over HTTPS. See xref:authoring-devfiles.adoc[] for detailed information about creating and using devfiles.

.Procedure
Execute the workspace by opening the following URL: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/#__<GitHubBranch>__]`

.Example
Use following URL format to open an experimental link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts[quarkus-quickstarts] branch hosted on link:https://workspaces.openshift.com[workspaces.openshift.com].
