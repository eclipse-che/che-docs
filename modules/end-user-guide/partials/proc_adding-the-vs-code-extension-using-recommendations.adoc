= Adding a VS Code extension using recommendations

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. To install an instance of {prod-short}, see {link-installing-an-instance}.
* Featured VS Code extensions are available in the {prod-short} plug-in registry.

.Procedure

Open a workspace without any existing devfile using the *{prod-short} dashboard*:

The recommendations plug-in will scan files, discover languages and install VS Code extensions matching these languages.
Disable this feature by setting `extensions.ignoreRecommendations` to true in the devfile attributes.

The recommendations plug-in can suggest VS Code extensions to install when opening files. It suggests extensions based on the workspace content, allowing the user to work with the given files.
Enable this feature by setting `extensions.openFileRecommendations` to true in the devfile attributes.
