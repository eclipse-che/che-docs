= Listing all workspaces

As a user, you can list your workspaces by using the command line.

.Prerequisites

* An active `{orch-cli}` session with permissions to `get` the `DevWorkspace` resources in your {orch-namespace} on the cluster. See {orch-cli-link}.

* You know the relevant {prod-short} user namespace on the cluster.
+
TIP: You can visit `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]/api/kubernetes/namespace` to get your {prod-short} user namespace as `name`.

* You are in the {prod-short} user namespace on the cluster.
+
[TIP]
====
On OpenShift, you can use the command-line `oc` tool to link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/developer-cli-commands.html#oc-project[display your current namespace or switch to a namespace].
====

.Procedure

* To list your workspaces, enter the following on a command line:
+
[source,subs="+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} get devworkspaces
