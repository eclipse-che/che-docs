= Adding `VS Code` extensions

To have the Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source cloud IDE automatically install chosen extensions, you have to add an `extensions.json` file to the remote Git repository that contains your project source code and that will be cloned into workspaces.

.Prerequisites
* {prod-short} has network access to the link:https://www.open-vsx.org/[OpenVSX registry].

[TIP]
====
To install recommended extensions in a restricted environment, consider these options:

* xref:administration-guide:configuring-the-open-vsx-registry-url.adoc[] to point to your OpenVSX registry.

* xref:defining-a-common-ide.adoc[].

* link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix[Installing extensions from VSX files].
====

.Procedure

. Create a `.vscode/extensions.json` file in the remote Git repository.

. Go to the link:https://www.open-vsx.org/[Open VSX registry] and copy the **Unique identifier** of each chosen extension from the extension-listing page to the `extensions.json` file as follows:
+
[source,json,subs="+quotes"]
----
  {
    "recommendations": [
      "__<Unique_identifier_of_extension_A>__",
      "__<Unique_identifier_of_extension_B>__",
      "__<Unique_identifier_of_extension_C>__"
    ]
  }
----

.Verification

. xref:starting-a-new-workspace-with-a-clone-of-a-git-repository.adoc[Start a new workspace by using the URL of the remote Git repository] that contains the created `extensions.json` file.
. In the IDE of the workspace, press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+X] or go to *Extensions* to find each of the extensions listed in the file.
