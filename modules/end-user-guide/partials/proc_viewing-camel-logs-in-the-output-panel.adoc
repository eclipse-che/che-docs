= Viewing Camel logs in the Output panel

The Camel language server is a SpringBoot application that writes its log to the `$\{java.io.tmpdir}/log-camel-lsp.out` file. Typically, `$\{java.io.tmpdir}` points to the `/tmp` directory, so the filename is `/tmp/log-camel-lsp.out`.


.Procedure

The Camel language server logs are printed in the *Output* channel named *Language Support for Apache Camel*.

NOTE: The output channel is created only at the first created log entry on the client side. It may be absent when everything is going well.
