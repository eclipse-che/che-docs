This section describes how to remotely access {prod-short} workspaces outside of the browser.

{prod-short} workspaces exist as containers and are, by default, modified from a browser window. In addition to this, there are the following methods of interacting with a {prod-short} workspace:

* Opening a command line in the workspace container using the Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`
* Uploading and downloading files using the `kubectl` tool
