OpenShift {ocp3-ver}, secrets mounted as file overrides volume mounts defined in the devfile.

This section describes how to mount a secret from the user's {orch-namespace} as a file in single-workspace or multiple-workspace containers of {prod-short}.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. To install an instance of {prod-short}, see {link-installing-an-instance}.

.Procedure

. Create a new {platforms-name} secret in the {platforms-name} {orch-namespace} where a {prod-short} workspace will be created.

* The labels of the secret that is about to be created must match the set of labels configured in `che.workspace.provision.secret.labels` property of {prod-short}. The default labels are:

* `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: che.eclipse.org` 
* `app.kubernetes.io/component: workspace-secret`:
