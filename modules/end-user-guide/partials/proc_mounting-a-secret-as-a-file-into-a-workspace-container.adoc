= Mounting a secret as a file into a workspace container

OpenShift {ocp3-ver}, secrets mounted as a file override volume mounts defined in the devfile.

In {prod-short}, you can mount the {platforms-name} secret from your {orch-namespace} as a file in single-workspace or multiple-workspace containers.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. See {link-installing-an-instance}.

.Procedure

. Create a new secret in the {platforms-namespace} where a new workspace is deployed.
. Match the secret's `labels` to the set of labels configured in the `che.workspace.provision.secret.labels` property of {prod-short}.
. Define the default behavior for mounting secrets in the `automount-workspace-secret` annotation, which takes a boolean value:
** `'true'` enables automatic mounting into all workspace containers.
** `'false'` disables automatic mounting into all workspace containers. (To mount a secret, a user must request it in the devfile component by using the `automountWorkspaceSecrets:true` property.)
. Set a `mount-path` for the file.
. Include the `mount-as: file` annotation.
. Set the filename in the secret's `data` field.
+
NOTE: The {orch-name} secret can contain several `data` items. The names of `data` items must match the name of the secret's file mounted into the container.
