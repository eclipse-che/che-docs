= Differences in Che-Theia Webview in single-host mode and multihost mode

:context: differences-in-how-che-theia-webview-works-on-a-single-host-mode-comparing-to-a-multi-host-mode

Depending on which Che deployment strategy is used, single-host or multihost, there are differences in how Che-Theia Webview API works.

== What’s a Webview

Webview Plug-in API allows creating a view within Che-Theia to show an arbitrary HTML content. Internally, it’s implemented with an link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe[iframe] and link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API[service worker].

== Webview in multihost mode

When {prod} is deployed in multihost mode, Webview content is served on a separate link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Origin[origin]. That means it’s isolated from the main Che-Theia context. So, a contributed view has no access:

* to the top-level DOM
* to the Che-Theia state, like local storage, cookies, and so on.

== Webview in single-host mode

When {prod} is deployed in single-host mode, Webview content is loaded through the same origin as the main Che-Theia context. It means that nothing prevents external content from accessing the main Che-Theia in a browser. So, pay extra attention to what content may be loaded by different Plugins that contribute the Webviews.
