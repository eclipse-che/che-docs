= Building default IntelliJ editor images

This procedure describes how to build an IntelliJ-based editor image using the default values proposed by the build script.

.Prerequisites

* A Docker version supporting link:https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/[Docker BuildKit]. Docker 18.09 or greater.

* On the macOS platform: the `+gnu-getopt+` tool is available.


.Procedure

. Get a local copy of the link:https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images[JetBrains Projector Editor Images repository].
+
----
$ git clone https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images
$ cd jetbrains-editor-images
----

. Build JetBrains IDE based on the predefined configuration, and reply to the prompt to identify the IDE name and version to build:
+
----
$ ./projector.sh build
[info] Select the IDE package to build (default is 'IntelliJ IDEA Community'):
       1) IntelliJ IDEA Community
       2) PyCharm Community
[info] Select the IDE package version to build (default is '2020.3.3'):
       1) 2020.3.3
       2) 2020.3.2
       3) 2020.3.1
----

. To test the container, run it locally and navigate to `++http://localhost:8887++`, to access the IntelliJ-based IDE.
+
----
$ ./projector.sh run
----

. Publish the container to a registry accessible by {prod-short}, and remember the image location to define the value of __<IntelliJ-container-image>__ for the next step: xref:using-intellij-based-ides.adoc[].
