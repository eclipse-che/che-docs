:context: developer-workspaces

{prod} provides developer workspaces with everything you need to code, build, test, run, and debug applications:

* Project source code
* Web-based integrated development environment (IDE)
* Tool dependencies needed by developers to work on a project
* Application runtime: a replica of the environment where the application runs in production

Pods manage each component of a {prod-short} workspace. Therefore, everything running in a {prod-short} workspace is running inside containers. This makes a {prod-short} workspace highly portable.

The embedded browser-based IDE is the point of access for everything running in a {prod-short} workspace. This makes a {prod-short} workspace easy to share.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, it is possible to run only one workspace at a time. To increase the number of concurrent workspaces a user can run, update the CheCluster:

[subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} patch checluster/{prod-checluster} -n {prod-namespace} --type=merge \
-p '{ "spec": { "server": { "customCheProperties": { "CHE_LIMITS_USER_WORKSPACES_RUN_COUNT": "-1" } } } }'
----

.Features and benefits
[options="header",cols="h,,"]
|===
| Features
| Traditional IDE workspaces
| {prod} workspaces

| Configuration and installation required
| Yes.
| No.

| Embedded tools
| Partial. IDE plug-ins need configuration. Dependencies need installation and configuration. Example: JDK, Maven, Node.
| Yes. Plug-ins provide their dependencies.

| Application runtime provided
| No. Developers have to manage that separately.
| Yes. Application runtime is replicated in the workspace.

| Shareable
| No. Or not easily
| Yes. Developer workspaces are shareable with a URL.

| Capable of being versioned
| No
| Yes. Devfiles exist with project source code.

| Accessible from anywhere
| No. Installation is needed.
| Yes. Only requires a browser.
|===

Start a {prod-short} workspace:

* xref:configuring-a-workspace-with-dashboard.adoc[]

Use the Dashboard to discover {prod-short} {prod-ver}:

* xref:creating-a-workspace-from-a-code-sample.adoc[]
* xref:importing-the-source-code-of-a-project-into-a-workspace.adoc[]

Use a devfile as the preferred way to start a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace:

* xref:authoring-devfiles.adoc[]
* xref:importing-kubernetes-applications-into-a-workspace.adoc[]

Use the browser-based IDE as the preferred way to interact with a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace. For an alternative way to interact with a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace, see: xref:remotely-accessing-workspaces.adoc[].
