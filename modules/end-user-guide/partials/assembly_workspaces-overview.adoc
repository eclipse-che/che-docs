{prod} provides developer workspaces with everything you need to code, build, test, run, and debug applications:

* Project source code
* Web-based integrated development environment (IDE)
* Tool dependencies needed by developers to work on a project
* Application runtime: a replica of the environment where the application runs in production

Pods manage each component of a {prod-short} workspace. Therefore, everything running in a {prod-short} workspace is running inside containers. This makes a {prod-short} workspace highly portable.

The embedded browser-based IDE is the point of access for everything running in a {prod-short} workspace. This makes a {prod-short} workspace easy to share.

Use the Dashboard to discover {prod-short} {prod-ver}:

* xref:creating-a-workspace-from-a-code-sample.adoc[]
* xref:importing-the-source-code-of-a-project-into-a-workspace.adoc[]

Use a devfile as the preferred way to start a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace:

* xref:authoring-devfiles.adoc[]
* xref:importing-kubernetes-applications-into-a-workspace.adoc[]

Use the browser-based IDE as the preferred way to interact with a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace. For an alternative way to interact with a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace, see: xref:remotely-accessing-workspaces.adoc[].
