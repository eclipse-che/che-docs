{prod} provides developer workspaces with everything needed to a code, build, test, run, and debug applications. To allow that, the developer workspaces provide four main components:

. The source code of a project.
. A web-based integrated development environment (IDE).
. Tool dependencies, needed by developers to work on a project.
. Application runtime: a replica of the environment where the application runs in production.

Pods manage each component of a {prod-short} workspace. Therefore, everything running in a {prod-short} workspace is running inside containers. This makes a {prod-short} workspace highly portable.

The embedded browser-based IDE is the point of access for everything running in a {prod-short} workspace. This makes a {prod-short} workspace easy to share.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, it is possible to run only one workspace at a time. To increase the number of concurrent workspaces a user can run, patch the checluster:

[subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ oc patch checluster {prod-checluster} -n {prod-namespace} --type=merge \
-p '{ "spec": { "server": { "customCheProperties": { "CHE_LIMITS_USER_WORKSPACES_RUN_COUNT": "-1" } } } }'
----

For additional information, see: xref:installation-guide:advanced-configuration-options-for-the-che-server-component.adoc#users-workspace-limits[Users workspace limits].

.Features and benefits
[options="header",cols="h,,"]
|===
| Features
| Traditional IDE workspaces
| {prod} workspaces

| Configuration and installation required
| Yes.
| No.

| Embedded tools
| Partial. IDE plug-ins need configuration. Dependencies need installation and configuration. Example: JDK, Maven, Node.
| Yes. Plug-ins provide their dependencies.

| Application runtime provided
| No. Developers have to manage that separately.
| Yes. Application runtime is replicated in the workspace.

| Shareable
| No. Or not easily
| Yes. Developer workspaces are shareable with a URL.

| Versionable
| No
| Yes. Devfiles exist with project source code.

| Accessible from anywhere
| No. Installation is needed.
| Yes. Only requires a browser.
|===

To start a {prod-short} workspace, following options are available:

* xref:creating-and-configuring-a-new-workspace.adoc[]
* xref:configuring-a-workspace-using-a-devfile.adoc[]

Use the Dashboard to discover {prod-short} {prod-ver}:

* xref:creating-a-workspace-from-code-sample.adoc[]
* xref:creating-a-workspace-by-importing-source-code-of-a-project.adoc[]

Use a devfile as the preferred way to start a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace:

* xref:making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile.adoc[]
* xref:importing-kubernetes-applications-into-a-workspace.adoc[]

Use the browser-based IDE as the preferred way to interact with a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace. For an alternative way to interact with a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace, see: xref:remotely-accessing-workspaces.adoc[].
