= Creating a workspace using {prod-cli} and a local devfile

A {prod-short} workspace can be created by pointing the `{prod-cli}` tool to a locally stored devfile. The {prod-short} instance then uses the discovered devfile to build a workspace.

.Prerequisites
* A running instance of {prod}. To install an instance of {prod}, see xref:installation-guide:installing-che.adoc[].
* The {prod-short} CLI management tool. See xref:overview:using-the-chectl-management-tool.adoc[].
* The devfile is available on the local filesystem in the current working directory. See xref:configuring-a-workspace-using-a-devfile.adoc[] for detailed information about creating and using devfiles.
* You are logged in to {prod}. See xref:end-user-guide:navigating-{prod-id-short}-using-the-dashboard.adoc#logging-in-to-{prod-id}-using-{prod-cli}_navigating-{prod-id-short}-using-the-dashboard[How to login into {prod-short} using {prod-cli}]

.Example
Download the `devfile.yaml` file from the link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/devfile.yaml[GitHub repository]  to the current working directory.

.Procedure
. Run a workspace from a devfile using the `workspace:create` parameter with the `{prod-cli}` tool as follows:

[subs="+attributes,+quotes"]
----
$ {prod-cli} workspace:create --name=__<WORKSPACE_NAME>__ \ <1>
--devfile=devfile.yaml --start \
-n {prod-namespace}
----
<1> The workspace name to create

NOTE: If `--devfile` flag is omitted then {prod-cli} looks for `devfile.yaml` or `devfile.yml` files in the current directory to create a workspace from.
