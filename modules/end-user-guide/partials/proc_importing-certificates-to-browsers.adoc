= Importing certificates to browsers

This section describes how to import a root certificate authority into a web browser to use {prod-short} with self-signed TLS certificates.

When a TLS certificate is not trusted, the error message *"Your {prod2} server may be using a self-signed certificate. To resolve the issue, import the server CA certificate in the browser."* blocks the login process. To prevent this, add the public part of the self-signed CA certificate into the browser after installing {prod-short}.
