= Adding a Visual Studio Code extension to the Che plug-ins registry

To use a Visual Studio Code extension in a {prod-short} workspace, {prod-short} need to consume metadata describing the extension. The {prod-short} plug-ins registry is a static website publishing metadata for common Visual Studio Code extensions. Visual Studio Code extension metadata for the {prod-short} plug-ins registry is generated from a central file named `che-theia-plugins.yaml`.

To add or modify an extension in the {prod-short} plug-ins registry, edit the `che-theia-plugins.yaml` file and add relevant metadata.

[NOTE]
====
This article describes the steps needed to build the plug-ins registry with a custom plug-in definition. If you are looking to create a custom `meta.yaml` file that can be directly referenced in a devfile, see xref:end-user-guide:publishing-metadata-for-a-vs-code-extension.adoc[].
====


.Prerequisite
* A working knowledge of customizing the registries, see xref:administration-guide:customizing-the-registries.adoc[]
* A link to a sidecar container image, should the Visual Studio Code extension require one.


.Procedure

. Edit the `che-theia-plugins.yaml` file and create a new entry.

----

<1> (OPTIONAL) The ID of the plug-in, useful if a plug-in has multiple entries for one repository. For example, Java 8 and Java 11.
<2> Repository information about the plug-in. If ID is specified, then this field is not a list element.
<3> The URL to the Git repository of the extension.
<4> Tag or SHA1 ID of the upstream repository that hosts the extension, corresponding to a version, snapshot, or release.
<5> (OPTIONAL) An alias for this plug-in. For anything listed here, a `meta.yaml` file is generated.
<6> (OPTIONAL) Plug-in preferences in freeform format.
<7> (OPTIONAL) If the plug-in runs in a sidecar container, then the sidecar information is specified here.
<8> A location of a container image to be used as the plug-in sidecar. This line cannot be specified concurrently with `directory`. See above.
<9> (OPTIONAL) The name of the sidecar container.
<10> (OPTIONAL) The memory limit of the sidecar container.
<11> (OPTIONAL) The memory request of the sidecar container.
<12> (OPTIONAL) The CPU limit of the sidecar container.
<13> (OPTIONAL) The CPU request of the sidecar container.
<14> (OPTIONAL) Definitions of root process commands inside the container.
<15> (OPTIONAL) Arguments for root process commands inside the container.
<16> (OPTIONAL) Any volume mounting information for the sidecar container.
<17> The name of the mount.
<18> The path to the mount.
<19> (OPTIONAL) Any endpoint information for the sidecar container.
<20> Endpoint name.
<21> A Boolean value determining whether the endpoint is exposed publicly.
<22> The port number.
<23> Attributes relating to the endpoint.
<24> Direct link or links to the `vsix` files included with the plug-in. The `vsix` built by the repository specified, such as the main extension, must be listed first.
<25> # TODO #
<26> (OPTIONAL) Extra dependencies in addition to the one listed in extensionDependencies field of package.json.
<27> (OPTIONAL) Do not include this plug-in in index.json if true. Useful in case of dependencies that you do not want to expose as standalone plug-ins.
<28> (OPTIONAL) Do not examine specified dependencies from extensionDependencies field of package.json (only for `meta.yaml` generation).
<29> (OPTIONAL) Extra dependencies in addition to the one listed in extensionDependencies field of package.json (only for `meta.yaml` generation).


. Run the `build.sh` script with the options of your choosing. The build process will generate `meta.yaml` files automatically, based on the entries in the `che-theia-plugins.yaml` file.
. Use the resulting plug-ins registry image in {prod-short}, or copy the `meta.yaml` file out of the registry container and reference it directly as an HTTP resource.
