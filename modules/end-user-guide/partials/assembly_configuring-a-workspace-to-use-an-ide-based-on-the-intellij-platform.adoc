This section describes how to configure a workspace to use an IDE based on the IntelliJ Platform.

NOTE: When the {prod-short} instance is running with the {prod-short} Server workspaces engine, the IDE has the responsibility to clone the code repositories referenced in the devfile. The IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform donâ€™t support this feature. In the IDE, click  btn:[New Project] to create a project or btn:[Get from VCS] to checkout a repository.
