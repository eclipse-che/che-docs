= Creating a workspace from a code sample

You can create a new workspace by using one of the code samples included in {prod-short}.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. See xref:installation-guide:installing-che.adoc[].

.Procedure

. Go to the xref:navigating-che-using-the-dashboard.adoc[Dashboard] of {prod-short}.

. In the left navigation panel, click btn:[Create Workspace] to go to the *Quick Add* tab that contains code samples.

. Select a sample to start a new workspace.

. Wait for the initialized workspace to start and for the IDE to open.
