= Adding a VS Code extension using the workspace configuration

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. To install an instance of {prod-short}, see {link-installing-an-instance}.

* An existing workspace defined on this instance of {prod-short}.

* The VS Code extension is available in the {prod-short} plug-in registry, or metadata for the VS Code extension are available. See xref:publishing-metadata-for-a-vs-code-extension.adoc[].

.Procedure

To add a VS Code extension using the workspace configuration:

. Click the *Workspaces* tab on the *Dashboard* and select the plug-in destination workspace.
+
The *Workspace __<workspace-name>__* window is opened showing the details of the workspace.

. Click the *devfile* tab.

. Locate the *components* section, and add a new entry with the following structure:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
 - type: chePlugin
   id:              <1>
----
<1> ID format: `_<publisher>/<plug-inName>/<plug-inVersion>_`
+
{prod-short} automatically adds the other fields to the new component.
+
Alternatively, you can link to a `meta.yaml` file hosted on GitHub, using the dedicated reference field.
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
 - type: chePlugin
   reference:              <1>
----
<1> `pass:c,a,q[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/__<username>__/__<registryRepository>__/v3/plugins/__<publisher>__/__<plug-inName>__/__<plug-inVersion>__/meta.yaml]`
+

. Restart the workspace for the changes to take effect.
