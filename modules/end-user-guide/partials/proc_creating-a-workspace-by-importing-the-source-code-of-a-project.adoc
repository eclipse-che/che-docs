With {prod-short}, you can import and work on your project's current codebase in a workspace.

You can import your project's current codebase into a workspace with any of the following options:

* xref:creating-a-custom-workspace-from-the-dashboard_{context}[Importing a project when creating a workspace]
* xref:importing-from-the-dashboard-into-an-existing-workspace_{context}[Importing a project into a created workspace]

* xref:importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}[Importing a project with `git clone` in a terminal]

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}

To install {prod-short}, see the xref:installation-guide:installing-che.adoc[Installation Guide].

* A configured workspace with plug-ins related to your development environment defined on this instance of {prod} xref:configuring-a-workspace-with-dashboard.adoc[Configuring a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace]

== Importing a project when creating a workspace

You can import your project when you create a workspace with a devfile template and your project's URL.

.Procedure

Import your project's codebase while creating a workspace as follows:

. Go to the xref:navigating-che-using-the-dashboard.adoc[Dashboard] of {prod-short}.

. In the left navigation panel, click btn:[+Create Workspace] to open the *Custom Workspace* tab.

. Enter a *Workspace Name* for the workspace that you are creating.
+
[NOTE]
.New workspace name
====
The workspace name can be auto-generated based on the underlying devfile of the stack. Generated names always consist of the devfile `metadata.generateName` property as the prefix and of four random characters.
====

. Select a devfile template from the drop-down list.
+

=== Adding commands to an imported project
//Is this section only relevant as a subsection here or does it also apply to the other sections in this file? If the latter, consider promoting it to the next heading level. In any case, not checked by me, max-cx

You can add commands to your project to run, debug, or start your application in a browser.

.Prerequisites

* A workspace with a project in it

.Procedure

To add commands to a project:

. Open the workspace configuration in the *Dashboard*, then select the *Devfile* tab.

. Modify the `commands` section of the devfile in the devfile editor on the page.

. Open the workspace.

. To run a command, select *Terminal* > *Run Task* from the main menu.

[id="importing-to-a-running-workspace-using-the-git-clone-command_{context}"]
== Importing a project with *Git: Clone* in the GUI

You can import your project into a running workspace with the *Git: Clone* command in the graphic user interface of {prod-short}.
 
.Prerequisites
* A started workspace

.Procedure

Import your project's codebase into a running workspace as follows:

. Select the *Git: Clone* command on the *Welcome* screen or from the command palette:
* On the *Welcome* screen, click the *Git: Clone* link.
+
image::workspaces/{project-context}-welcome.png[Welcome screen]

* To open the command palette, press F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P.

[id="importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}"]
== Importing a project with `git clone` in a terminal

You can use the command line to import your project into a running workspace.

.Prerequisites
* A started workspace

.Procedure

Import your project's codebase into the running workspace as follows:

. Open a terminal inside the running workspace.

. Type the `git clone` command to pull code.
+
image::workspaces/git-clone-terminal.png[Run git clone in a terminal]

[NOTE]
====
Importing or deleting workspace projects in the terminal does not update the workspace configuration, and the IDE does not reflect the changes in the *Devfile* tab in the dashboard.

Similarly, when you add a project using the *Dashboard* and then delete it with `rm -fr myproject`, it may still appear in the *Devfile* tab.
