= Creating a workspace by importing the source code of a project

:context: creating-a-workspace-by-importing-the-source-code-of-a-project

This section describes how to create a new workspace for editing an existing codebase.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. To install an instance of {prod-short}, see {link-installing-an-instance}.

* An existing workspace with plug-ins related to your development environment defined on this instance of {prod} xref:configuring-a-workspace-with-dashboard.adoc[].

A user can progress with two methods that have to be applied *before* starting a workspace:

* xref:creating-a-custom-workspace-from-the-dashboard_{context}[Select a sample from the Dashboard, then change the devfile to include your project]
* xref:authoring-devfiles-version-2.adoc[]

To create a new workspace for editing an existing codebase, use one of the following methods *after* the workspace has been started:

* xref:importing-from-the-dashboard-into-an-existing-workspace_{context}[Import from the *Dashboard* into an existing workspace]
* xref:importing-to-a-running-workspace-using-the-git-clone-command_{context}[Import to a running workspace using the `git clone` command]
* xref:importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}[Import to a running workspace using `git clone` in a terminal]

[id="creating-a-custom-workspace-from-the-dashboard_{context}"]
== Select a sample from the Dashboard, then change the devfile to include your project

* In the left navigation panel, go to *Create Workspace*.

* In a case it's not selected already, click the *Custom Workspace* tab.

* In the *Devfile* section, select the devfile template that will be used to build and run projects.

* In the *Devfile editor*, update `projects` section:

[NOTE]
.Example: add a project
====
To add a project into the workspace, add or edit the following section:

[source,yaml]
----
projects:
  - name: che
    source:
      type: git
      location: 'https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server.git'
----
See the xref:authoring-devfiles-version-1.adoc[Devfile reference].
====

* To open the workspace, click the btn:[Create & Open] button.


[id="importing-from-the-dashboard-into-an-existing-workspace_{context}"]
== Importing from the Dashboard into an existing workspace

* From the *Dashboard*, select *Workspaces*.
* Select your workspace by selecting its name. This will link you to the workspace's *Overview* tab.
* Open *Devfile* tab where you can enter your own YAML configuration.
* Add the project.

[id="editing-the-commands-after-importing-a-project_{context}"]
=== Editing the commands after importing a project

After you have a project in your workspace, you can add commands to it. Adding commands to your projects allows you to run, debug, or start your application in a browser.

To add commands to the project:

. Open the workspace configuration in the *Dashboard*, then select the *Devfile* tab.

. Modify the commands field.

. Open the workspace.

. To run a command, select *Terminal* > *Run Task* from the main menu.
+
image::workspaces/run-command.png[Run task]

. To configure commands, select *Terminal* > *Configure Tasks* from the main menu.
+

[id="importing-to-a-running-workspace-using-the-git-clone-command_{context}"]
== Importing to a running workspace using the *Git: Clone* command

To import to a running workspace using the *Git: Clone* command:

. Start a workspace, then use the *Git: Clone* command from the command palette or the Welcome screen to import a project to a running workspace.
+
image::workspaces/{project-context}-welcome.png[Welcome screen]

. Open the command palette by using `F1`, `CTRL-SHIFT-P`, or the link displayed on the Welcome screen.
+
image::workspaces/git-clone-command.png[Invoke git clone command]

. Enter the path to the project that is about to be cloned.

[id="importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}"]
== Importing to a running workspace with `git clone` in a terminal

In addition to the approaches above, you can also start a workspace, open a *Terminal*, and type `git clone` to pull code.

[NOTE]
====
Importing or deleting workspace projects in the terminal does not update the workspace configuration, and the IDE does not reflect the changes in the *Devfile* tab in the dashboard.

Similarly, when you add a project using the *Dashboard*, then delete it with `rm -fr myproject`, it may still appear in the *Devfile* tab.
