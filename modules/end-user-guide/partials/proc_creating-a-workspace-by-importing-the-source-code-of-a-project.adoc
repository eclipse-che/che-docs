With {prod-short}, you can import and work on your project's current codebase in a workspace.

You can import your project's current codebase into a workspace with any of the following options:

* xref:creating-a-custom-workspace-from-the-dashboard_{context}[Importing a project when creating a workspace]
* xref:importing-from-the-dashboard-into-an-existing-workspace_{context}[Importing a project into a created workspace]
* xref:importing-to-a-running-workspace-using-the-git-clone-command_{context}[Importing a project with *Git: Clone* in the GUI]
* xref:importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}[Importing a project with `git clone` in a terminal]

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}
+
To install {prod-short}, see the xref:installation-guide:installing-che.adoc[Installation Guide].

* A configured workspace with plug-ins related to your development environment defined on this instance of {prod}.

== Importing a project when creating a workspace

You can import your project when you create a workspace with a devfile template and your project's URL.

.Procedure

Import your project's codebase while creating a workspace as follows:

. Go to the xref:navigating-che-using-the-dashboard.adoc[Dashboard] of {prod-short}.

. In the left navigation panel, click btn:[Create Workspace] to go to the *Custom Workspace* tab.

. Enter a workspace name.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not enter a *Workspace Name* for your workspace, {prod-short} generates a unique name for a new workspace from the devfile's `metadata.generateName` property followed by four random characters.
====

. Select a devfile template from the drop-down list.
+

=== Adding commands to an imported project
//Is this section only relevant as a subsection here or does it also apply to the other sections in this file? If the latter, consider promoting it to the next heading level. In any case, not checked by me, max-cx

You can add commands to your project to run, debug, or start your application in a browser.

.Prerequisites

* A workspace with a project in it

.Procedure

To add commands to a project:

. Go to the xref:navigating-che-using-the-dashboard.adoc[Dashboard] of {prod-short}.

. Under *RECENT WORKSPACES*, hover over the name of the workspace to which you will import the project.

. Click the three dots next to the workspace name.

. Select *Edit Workspace*.

. In the *Devfile* tab, edit the `commands` section of the devfile in the editor on the page.

. Click btn:[Save].

. Open the workspace.

. To run a command, select *Terminal* > *Run Task* from the main menu.

== Importing a project with *Git: Clone* in the GUI

You can import your project into a running workspace with the *Git: Clone* command in the graphic user interface of {prod-short}.
 
.Prerequisites
* A started workspace

.Procedure

Import your project's codebase into a running workspace as follows:

. Select the *Git: Clone* command on the *Welcome* screen or from the command palette:
* On the *Welcome* screen, click the *Git: Clone* link.
+

[id="importing-to-a-running-workspace-with-git-clone-in-a-terminal_{context}"]
== Importing a project with `git clone` in a terminal

You can use the command line to import your project into a running workspace.

.Prerequisites
* A running workspace

.Procedure

Import your project's codebase into the running workspace as follows:

. Open a terminal inside the running workspace.

. Type the `git clone` command to pull code.
+

[NOTE]
====
Importing or deleting workspace projects in the terminal does not update the workspace configuration, and the IDE does not reflect the changes in the *Devfile* tab in the dashboard.

Similarly, when you add a project in the *Dashboard* and then delete the project with the `rm -fr myproject` command, the project may still appear in the *Devfile* tab.
