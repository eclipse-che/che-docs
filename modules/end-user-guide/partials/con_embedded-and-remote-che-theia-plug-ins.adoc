= Embedded and remote Che-Theia plug-ins

Developer workspaces in {prod} provide all dependencies needed to work on a project. The application includes the dependencies needed by all the tools and plug-ins used.

Based on the required dependencies, Che-Theia plug-in can run as: 

* Embedded, also know as local
* Remote


[id="embedded-or-local-plug-ins_{context}"]
== Embedded (local) plug-ins

The Embedded plug-ins are plug-ins without specific dependencies that are injected into the Che-Theia IDE. These plug-ins use the Node.js runtime, which runs in the IDE container. 

Examples:

* Code linting
* New set of commands
* New UI components

To include a Che-Theia plug-in or Visual Studio Code extension, define a URL to the plug-in `.theia` archive binary in the `meta.yaml` file. See
xref:adding-a-vs-code-extension-to-a-workspace.adoc[]

When starting a workspace, {prod-short} downloads and unpacks the plug-in binaries and includes them in the Che-Theia editor container. The Che-Theia editor initializes the plug-ins when it starts.


[id="remote-plug-ins_{context}"]
== Remote plug-ins

The plug-in relies on dependencies or it has a back end. It runs in its own sidecar container, and all dependencies are packaged in the container.

A remote Che-Theia plug-in consist of two parts:

* Che-Theia plug-in or Visual Studio Code extension binaries. The definition in the `meta.yaml` file is the same as for embedded plug-ins.

* Container image definition, for example, `eclipse/che-theia-dev:nightly`. From this image, {prod-short} creates a separate container inside a workspace.

Examples:

* Java Language Server
* Python Language Server

When starting a workspace, {prod-short} creates a container from the plug-in image, downloads and unpacks the plug-in binaries, and includes them in the created container. The Che-Theia editor connects to the remote plug-ins when it starts.


== Comparison matrix

* Embedded plug-ins are those Che-Theia plug-ins or Visual Studio Code extensions that do not require extra dependencies inside its container.

* Remote plug-ins are containers that contain a plug-in with all required dependencies.

[options="header",cols="h,,,"]
|===
|  
| Configure RAM per plug-in
| Environment dependencies
| Create separated container

| Remote
| TRUE
| Plug-in uses dependencies defined in the remote container.
| TRUE

| Embedded
| FALSE (users can configure RAM for the whole editor container, but not per plug-in)
| Plug-in uses dependencies from the editor container; if container does not include these dependencies, the plug-in fails or does not function as expected.
| FALSE
|===

Depending on your use case and the capabilities provided by your plug-in, select one of the described running modes.
