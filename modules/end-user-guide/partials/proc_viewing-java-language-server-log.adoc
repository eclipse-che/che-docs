= Viewing the Java language server log

.Procedure

The Eclipse JDT Language Server has its own workspace where it logs errors, information about executed commands, and events.

. To open this log file, open a terminal in the container that is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in. You can also view the log file by running the *Java: Open Java Language Server log file* command.

. Run `cat __<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>__` where `PATH_TO_LOG_FILE` is
`/home/theia/.theia/workspace-storage/__<workspace_name>__/redhat.java/jdt_ws/.metadata/.log`.
