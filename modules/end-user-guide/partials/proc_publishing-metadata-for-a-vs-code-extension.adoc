= Publishing metadata for a VS Code extension

To use a VS Code extension in a {prod-short} workspace, {prod-short} needs to consume metadata describing the extension. The {prod-short} plug-ins registry is a static website publishing metadata for common VS Code extensions.

This article describes how to publish metadata for an additional extension, not available in the {prod-short} plug-ins registry, by using the extension configuration `meta.yaml` file.

For details on adding a plugin to an existing plug-in registry, see xref:adding-a-vs-code-extension-to-the-che-plugin-registry.adoc[]

.Prerequisite

* If the VS Code extension requires it, the required associated container image is available.

.Procedure

. Create a `meta.yaml` file.

. Edit the `meta.yaml` file and provide the necessary information. The file must have the following structure:
+
