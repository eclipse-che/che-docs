= Generating workspace names

To specify a prefix for automatically generated workspace names, set the `generateName` parameter in the devfile:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  generateName: {project-context}-
----

The workspace name will be in the `<generateName>YYYYY` format (for example, `che-2y7kp`). `Y` is random `[a-z0-9]` character.

The following naming rules apply when creating workspaces:

* When `name` is defined, it is used as the workspace name: `<name>`
* When only `generateName` is defined, it is used as the base of the generated name: `<generateName>YYYYY`

[NOTE]
====
For workspaces created using a factory, defining `name` or `generateName` has the same effect. The defined value is used as the name prefix: `<name>YYYYY` or `<generateName>YYYYY`. When both `generateName` and `name` are defined, `generateName` takes precedence.
