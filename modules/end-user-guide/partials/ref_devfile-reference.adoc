[id="adding-a-name-to-a-devfile_{context}"]
== Adding a name to a devfile

Adding a name to a devfile is mandatory. Both `name` and `generateName` are optional attributes, but at least one of them must be defined.

.Procedure

. To specify a static name for the workspace, define the `name` attribute.

----
schemaVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: devfile-sample
----

. To specify a prefix for automatically generated workspace names, define the `generateName` attribute and don't define the `name` attribute. The workspace name will be in the `<generateName>YYYYY` format, for example, `devfile-sample-2y7kp`, where `Y` is a random `[a-z0-9]` character.

[NOTE]
====
For workspaces created using a factory, defining `name` or `generateName` has the same effect. The defined value is used as the name prefix: `<name>YYYYY` or `<generateName>YYYYY`. When both `generateName` and `name` are defined, `generateName` takes precedence.
====

[id="adding-projects-to-a-devfile_{context}"]
== Adding projects to a devfile

A devfile is designed to contain one or more projects. A workspace is created to develop those projects. Projects are added in the `projects` section of devfiles.

Each project in a single devfile must have:

* Unique name
* Source specified

Project source consists of two mandatory values: `type` and `location`.

`type`:: The kind of project-source provider.
`location`:: The URL of project source.

{prod-short} supports the following project types:

`git`:: Projects with sources in Git. The location points to a clone link.

`github`:: Same as `git` but for projects hosted on link:https://github.com/[GitHub] only. Use `git` for projects that do not use GitHub-specific features.

`zip`:: Projects with sources in a ZIP archive. Location points to a ZIP file.


=== Project-source type: git

[source,yaml]
----
source:
    type: git
    location: https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server.git
    startPoint: main           <1>
    tag: 7.34.0
    commitId: 36fe587
    branch: 7.34.x
    sparseCheckoutDir: core  <2>
----

<1> `startPoint`: The general value for `tag`, `commitId`, and `branch`. The `startPoint`, `tag`, `commitId`, and `branch` parameters are mutually exclusive. When more than one is supplied, the following order is used: `startPoint`, `tag`, `commitId`, `branch`.

<2> `sparseCheckoutDir`: The template for the sparse checkout Git feature. This is useful when only a part of a project, typically a single directory, is needed.

.`sparseCheckoutDir` parameter settings
====
* Set to `/my-module/` to create only the root `my-module` directory (and its content).

* Omit the leading slash (`my-module/`) to create all `my-module` directories that exist in the project. Including, for example, `/addons/my-module/`.
+
The trailing slash indicates that only directories with the given name (including their content) are created.

* Use wildcards to specify more than one directory name. For example, setting `module-*` checks out all directories of the given project that start with `module-`.
====

For more information, see link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-read-tree#_sparse_checkout[Sparse checkout in Git documentation].


=== Project-source type: zip

[source,yaml]
----
source:
    type: zip
    location: http://host.net/path/project-src.zip
----


=== Project clone-path parameter: clonePath

The `clonePath` parameter specifies the path into which the project is to be cloned. The path must be relative to the `/projects/` directory, and it cannot leave the `/projects/` directory. The default value is the project name.

.Example devfile with projects

----

[id="adding-components-to-a-devfile_{context}"]
== Adding components to a devfile

Each component in a single devfile must have a unique name.

=== Component type: cheEditor

Describes the editor used in the workspace by defining its `id`. A devfile can only contain one component of the `cheEditor` type.

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  - alias: theia-editor
    type: cheEditor
    id: eclipse/che-theia/next
----

When `cheEditor` is missing, a default editor is provided along with its default plug-ins. The default plug-ins are also provided for an explicitly defined editor with the same `id` as the default one (even if it is a different version). Che-Theia is configured as default editor along with the *{prod-short} Machine Exec* plug-in.

To specify that a workspace requires no editor, use the xref:attribute-editorfree_{context}[`editorFree:true` attribute] in the devfile attributes.

=== Component type: chePlugin

Describes plug-ins in a workspace by defining their `id`. A devfile is allowed to have multiple `chePlugin` components.

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/latest
----

Both types above use an ID, which is slash-separated publisher, name and version of plug-in from the {prod-short} Plug-in registry. Note that the {prod-short} Plug-in registry uses the `latest` version by default for all plug-ins.

To reference a custom plug-in by ID, build and deploy a custom plug-in registry. See xref:administration-guide:building-custom-registry-images.adoc[].

=== Specifying an alternative component registry

To specify an alternative registry for the `cheEditor` and `chePlugin` component types, use the `registryUrl` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     registryUrl: https://my-customregistry.com
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/latest
----

=== Specifying a component by linking to its descriptor


Rather than using the editor or plug-in `id` to specify `cheEditor` or `chePlugin`, provide a direct link to the component descriptor, typically named as `meta.yaml`, using the `reference` field:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com.../plugin/1.0.1/meta.yaml
----

The URL in the `reference` field must be publicly accessible and should directly point to a fetchable `meta.yaml` file. URLs that redirect or do not directly point to a `meta.yaml` file will cause the workspace startup to fail. To learn more about publishing `meta.yaml` files, see xref:publishing-metadata-for-a-vs-code-extension.adoc[].

NOTE: It is impossible to mix the `id` and `reference` fields in a single component definition; they are mutually exclusive.

=== Tuning chePlugin component configuration

A chePlugin component may need to be precisely tuned, and in such case, component preferences can be used. The example shows how to configure JVM using plug-in preferences.

[source,yaml]
----
  id: redhat/java/latest
  type: chePlugin
  preferences:
     java.jdt.ls.vmargs: '-noverify -Xmx1G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication'
----

Preferences may also be specified as an array:

[source,yaml]
----
  id: redhat/java/latest
  type: chePlugin
  preferences:
     go.lintFlags: ["--enable-all", "--new"]
----

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->]

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Terms = NO -->]

=== Component type: `kubernetes`

A complex component type that allows to apply configuration from a list of {orch-name} components.

The content can be provided through the `reference` attribute, which points to the file with the component content.

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: mysql
      type: kubernetes
      reference: petclinic.yaml
      selector:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
        app.kubernetes.io/component: database
        app.kubernetes.io/part-of: petclinic
----

Alternatively, to post a devfile with such components to REST API, the contents of the {orch-name} `List` object can be embedded into the devfile using the `referenceContent` field:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: mysql
      type: kubernetes
      reference: petclinic.yaml
      referenceContent: |
           kind: List
           items:
            -
             apiVersion: v1
             kind: Pod
             metadata:
              name: ws
             spec:
              containers:
              ... etc
----

=== Overriding container entrypoints

As with the xref:component-type-dockerimage_{context}[understood] by {platforms-name}).

There can be more containers in the list (contained in Pods or Pod templates of deployments). To select which containers to apply the entrypoint changes to.

The entrypoints can be defined as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: appDeployment
      type: kubernetes
      reference: app-deployment.yaml
      entrypoints:
      - parentName: mysqlServer
        command: ['sleep']
        args: ['infinity']
      - parentSelector:
          app: prometheus
        args: ['-f', '/opt/app/prometheus-config.yaml']
----

The `entrypoints` list contains constraints for picking the containers along with the `command` and `args` parameters to apply to them. In the example above, the constraint is `parentName: mysqlServer`, which will cause the command to be applied to all containers defined in any parent object called `mysqlServer`. The parent object is assumed to be a top level object in the list defined in the referenced file, which is `app-deployment.yaml` in the example above.

Other types of constraints (and their combinations) are possible:

`containerName`:: the name of the container
`parentName`:: the name of the parent object that (indirectly) contains the containers to override
`parentSelector`:: the set of labels the parent object needs to have

A combination of these constraints can be used to precisely locate the containers inside the referenced {orch-name} `List`.

=== Overriding container environment variables

To provision or override entrypoints in a {platforms-name} component, configure it in the following way:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
    - alias: appDeployment
      type: kubernetes
      reference: app-deployment.yaml
      env:
        - name: ENV_VAR
          value: value
----

This is useful for temporary content or without access to editing the referenced content. The specified environment variables are provisioned into each init container and containers inside all Pods and Deployments.

=== Specifying mount-source option

To specify a project sources directory mount into container(s), use the `mountSources` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
   components:
      - alias: appDeployment
        type: kubernetes
        reference: app-deployment.yaml
        mountSources: true
----

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Terms = YES -->]

If enabled, project sources mounts will be applied to every container of the given component.
This parameter is also applicable for `chePlugin` type components.

[id="component-type-dockerimage_{context}"]
=== Component type: dockerimage

A component type that allows to define a container image-based configuration of a container in a workspace. The `dockerimage` type of component brings in custom tools into the workspace. The component is identified by its image.

[source,yaml]
----
 components:
   - alias: maven
     type: dockerimage
     image: quay.io/eclipse/che-java11-maven:nightly
     volumes:
       - name: mavenrepo
         containerPath: /root/.m2
     env:
       - name: ENV_VAR
         value: value
     endpoints:
       - name: maven-server
         port: 3101
         attributes:
           protocol: http
           secure: 'true'
           public: 'true'
           discoverable: 'false'
     memoryLimit: 1536M
     memoryRequest: 256M
     command: ['tail']
     args: ['-f', '/dev/null']
----

*Example of a minimal `dockerimage` component*

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
    name: MyDevfile
components:
    - type: dockerimage
      image: golang
      memoryLimit: 512Mi
      command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
----

It specifies the type of the component, `dockerimage` and the `image` attribute names the image to be used for the component using the usual Docker naming conventions, that is, the above `type` attribute is equal to `docker.io/library/golang:latest`.

A `dockerimage` component has many features that enable augmenting the image with additional resources and information needed for meaningful integration of the *tool* provided by the image with {prod}.

=== Mounting project sources

For the `dockerimage` component to have access to the project sources, you must set the `mountSources` attribute to `true`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
    name: MyDevfile
components:
    - type: dockerimage
      image: golang
      memoryLimit: 512Mi
      command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
----

The sources is mounted on a location stored in the `CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT` environment variable that is made available in the running container of the image. This location defaults to `/projects`.

=== Container Entrypoint

The `command` attribute of the `dockerimage` along with other arguments, is used to modify the `entrypoint` command of the container created from the image. In {prod} the container is needed to run indefinitely so that you can connect to it and execute arbitrary commands in it at any time. Because the availability of the `sleep` command and the support for the `infinity` argument for it is different and depends on the base image used in the particular images, {prod-short} cannot insert this behavior automatically on its own. However, you can take advantage of this feature to, for example, start necessary servers with modified configurations, and so on.

=== Persistent Storage

Components of any type can specify the custom volumes to be mounted on specific locations within the image. Note that the volume names are shared across all components and therefore this mechanism can also be used to share file systems between components.

Example specifying volumes for `dockerimage` type:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
components:
  - type: dockerimage
    image: golang
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    mountSources: true
    command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
    volumes:
      - name: cache
        containerPath: /.cache
----

Example specifying volumes for `cheEditor`/`chePlugin` type:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
components:
  - type: cheEditor
    alias: theia-editor
    id: eclipse/che-theia/next
    env:
    - name: HOME
      value: $(CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT)
    volumes:
    - name: cache
      containerPath: /.cache
----

Example specifying volumes for `kubernetes`/`openshift` type:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
components:
  - type: openshift
    alias: mongo
    reference: mongo-db.yaml
    volumes:
    - name: mongo-persistent-storage
      containerPath: /data/db
----

=== Specifying container memory limit for components

To specify a container(s) memory limit for `dockerimage`, `chePlugin` or `cheEditor`, use the `memoryLimit` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/latest
     memoryLimit: 1Gi
   - alias: maven
     type: dockerimage
     image: quay.io/eclipse/che-java11-maven:nightly
     memoryLimit: 512M
----

This limit will be applied to every container of the given component.

For the `cheEditor` and `chePlugin` component types, RAM limits can be described in the plug-in descriptor file, typically named `meta.yaml`.

If none of them are specified, system-wide defaults will be applied (see description of `pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_SIDECAR_DEFAULT__MEMORY__LIMIT__MB]` system property).


=== Specifying container memory request for components

To specify a container(s) memory request for `dockerimage`, `chePlugin` or `cheEditor`, use the `memoryRequest` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/latest
     memoryLimit: 1Gi
     memoryRequest: 512M
   - alias: maven
     type: dockerimage
     image: quay.io/eclipse/che-java11-maven:nightly
     memoryLimit: 512M
     memoryRequest: 256M
----

This limit will be applied to every container of the given component.

For the `cheEditor` and `chePlugin` component types, RAM requests can be described in the plug-in descriptor file, typically named `meta.yaml`.

If none of them are specified, system-wide defaults are applied (see description of `pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_SIDECAR_DEFAULT__MEMORY__REQUEST__MB]` system property).


=== Specifying container CPU limit for components

To specify a container(s) CPU limit for `chePlugin`, `cheEditor` or `dockerimage` use the `cpuLimit` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/latest
     cpuLimit: 1.5
   - alias: maven
     type: dockerimage
     image: quay.io/eclipse/che-java11-maven:nightly
     cpuLimit: 750m
----

This limit will be applied to every container of the given component.

For the `cheEditor` and `chePlugin` component types, CPU limits can be described in the plug-in descriptor file, typically named `meta.yaml`.

If none of them are specified, system-wide defaults are applied (see description of `pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_SIDECAR_DEFAULT__CPU__LIMIT__CORES]` system property).


=== Specifying container CPU request for components

To specify a container(s) CPU request for `chePlugin`, `cheEditor` or `dockerimage` use the `cpuRequest` parameter:

[source,yaml]
----
  components:
   - alias: exec-plugin
     type: chePlugin
     id: eclipse/che-machine-exec-plugin/latest
     cpuLimit: 1.5
     cpuRequest: 0.225
   - alias: maven
     type: dockerimage
     image: quay.io/eclipse/che-java11-maven:nightly
     cpuLimit: 750m
     cpuRequest: 450m
----

This limit will be applied to every container of the given component.

For the `cheEditor` and `chePlugin` component types, CPU requests can be described in the plug-in descriptor file, typically named `meta.yaml`.

If none of them are specified, system-wide defaults are applied (see description of `pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_SIDECAR_DEFAULT__CPU__REQUEST__CORES]` system property).

=== Environment variables

{prod} allows you to configure Docker containers by modifying the environment variables available in component's configuration.
Environment variables are supported by the following component types: `dockerimage`, `chePlugin`, `cheEditor`, `kubernetes`, `openshift`.
In case component has multiple containers, environment variables will be provisioned to each container.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
components:
  - type: dockerimage
    image: golang
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    mountSources: true
    command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
    env:
      - name: GOPATH
        value: $(CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT)/go
  - type: cheEditor
    alias: theia-editor
    id: eclipse/che-theia/next
    memoryLimit: 2Gi
    env:
    - name: HOME
      value: $(CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT)
----

[NOTE]
====
* The variable expansion works between the environment variables, and it uses the {kubernetes} convention for the variable references.

* The predefined variables are available for use in custom definitions.
====

The following environment variables are pre-set by the {prod-short} server:

* `CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT`: The location of the projects directory (note that if the component does not mount the sources, the projects will not be accessible).

* `CHE_WORKSPACE_LOGS_ROOT__DIR`: The location of the logs common to all the components. If the component chooses to put logs into this directory, the log files are accessible from all other components.

* `CHE_API_INTERNAL`: The URL to the {prod-short} server API endpoint used for communication with the {prod-short} server.

* `CHE_WORKSPACE_ID`: The ID of the current workspace.

* `CHE_WORKSPACE_NAME`: The name of the current workspace.

* `CHE_WORKSPACE_NAMESPACE`: The {prod-short} {orch-namespace} of the current workspace. This environment variable is the name of the user or organization that the workspace belongs to. Note that this is different from
the {platforms-namespace} to which the workspace is deployed.

* `CHE_MACHINE_TOKEN`: The token used to authenticate the request against the {prod-short} server.

[subs="+quotes,macros"]
* `pass:[CHE_MACHINE_AUTH_SIGNATURE__PUBLIC__KEY]`: The public key used to secure the communication with the {prod-short} server.

* `CHE_MACHINE_AUTH_SIGNATURE__ALGORITHM`: The encryption algorithm used in the secured communication with the {prod-short} server.


A devfiles may only need the `CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT` environment variable to locate the cloned projects in the component's container. More advanced devfiles might use the `CHE_WORKSPACE_LOGS_ROOT__DIR` environment variable to read the logs (for example as part of a devfile command). The environment variables used to securely access the {prod-short} server are out of scope for devfiles and are present only for advanced use cases, which are handled by the {prod-short} plug-ins.

[id="endpoints_{context}"]
=== Endpoints

Components of any type can specify the endpoints that the Docker image exposes. These endpoints can be made accessible to the users if the {prod-short} cluster is running using a {kubernetes} ingress or an OpenShift route and to the other components within the workspace. You can create an endpoint for your application or database, if your application or database server is listening on a port and you need to be able to directly interact with it yourself or you allow other components to interact with it.

Endpoints have several properties as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
projects:
  - name: my-go-project
    clonePath: go/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project
    source:
      type: git
      location: https://github.com/acme/my-go-project.git
components:
  - type: dockerimage
    image: golang
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    mountSources: true
    command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
    env:
      - name: GOPATH
        value: $(CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT)/go
      - name: GOCACHE
        value: /tmp/go-cache
    endpoints:
     - name: web
       port: 8080
       attributes:
         discoverable: false
         public: true
         protocol: http
  - type: dockerimage
    image: postgres
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    env:
      - name: POSTGRES_USER
        value: user
      - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
        value: password
      - name: POSTGRES_DB
        value: database
    endpoints:
      - name: postgres
        port: 5432
        attributes:
          discoverable: true
          public: false
----

Here, there are two Docker images, each defining a single endpoint. Endpoint is an accessible port that can be made accessible inside the workspace or also publicly (example, from the UI). Each endpoint has a name and port, which is the port on which certain server running inside the container is listening. The following are a few attributes that you can set on the endpoint:

* `discoverable`: If an endpoint is discoverable, it means that it can be accessed using its name as the host name within the workspace containers (in the {platforms-name} terminology, a service is created for it with the provided name).
55
* `public`: The endpoint will be accessible outside of the workspace, too (such endpoint can be accessed from the {prod-short} user interface). Such endpoints are publicized always on port `80` or `443` (depending on whether `tls` is enabled in {prod-short}).

* `protocol`: For public endpoints the protocol is a hint to the UI on how to construct the URL for the endpoint access. Typical values are `http`, `https`, `ws`, `wss`.

* `secure`: A boolean value (defaulting to `false`) specifying whether the endpoint is put behind a JWT proxy requiring a JWT workspace token to grant access. The JWT proxy is deployed in the same Pod as the server and assumes the server listens solely on the local loop-back interface, such as `127.0.0.1`.
+
WARNING: Listening on any other interface than the local loop-back poses a security risk because such server is accessible without the JWT authentication within the cluster network on the corresponding IP addresses.

* `path`: The path portion of the URL to the endpoint. This defaults to `/`, meaning that the endpoint is assumed to be accessible at the web root of the server defined by the component.

* `unsecuredPaths`: A comma-separated list of endpoint paths that are to stay unsecured even if the `secure` attribute is set to `true`.

* `cookiesAuthEnabled`: When set to `true` (the default is `false`), the JWT workspace token is automatically fetched and included in a workspace-specific cookie to allow requests to pass through the JWT proxy.
+
WARNING: This setting potentially allows a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery[CSRF] attack when used in conjunction with a server using POST requests.


When starting a new server within a component, {prod-short} automatically detects this, and the UI offers to expose this port as a `public` port automatically. This behavior is useful for debugging a web application. It is impossible to do this for servers, such as a database server, which automatically starts at the container start. For such components, specify the endpoints explicitly.

Example specifying endpoints for `kubernetes`/`openshift` and `chePlugin`/`cheEditor` types:

=== {platforms-name} resources

To describe complex deployments, include references to {platforms-name} resource lists in the devfile. The {platforms-name} resource lists become a part of the workspace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* {prod-short} merges all resources from the {platforms-name} resource lists into a single deployment.

* Be careful when designing such lists to avoid name conflicts and other problems.

The preceding component references a file that is relative to the location of the devfile itself. Meaning, this devfile is only loadable by a {prod-short} factory to which you supply the location of the devfile and therefore it is able to figure out the location of the referenced {platforms-name} resource list.

For a basic example of a devfile with an associated {platforms-name} list, see link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/devfile/tree/master/samples/web-nodejs-with-db-sample[web-nodejs-with-db-sample] on redhat-developer GitHub.

If you use generic or large resource lists from which you will only need a subset of resources, you can select particular resources from the list using a selector (which, as the usual {platforms-name} selectors, works on the labels of the resources in the list).

Additionally, it is also possible to modify the entrypoints (command and arguments) of the containers present in the resource list.

[id="adding-commands-to-a-devfile_{context}"]
== Adding commands to a devfile

A devfile allows to specify commands to be available for execution in a workspace. Every command can contain a subset of actions, which are related to a specific component in whose container it will be executed.

[source,yaml]
----
 commands:
   - name: build
     actions:
       - type: exec
         component: mysql
         command: mvn clean
         workdir: /projects/spring-petclinic
----

You can use commands to automate the workspace. You can define commands for building and testing your code, or cleaning the database.

The following are two kinds of commands:

* {prod-short} specific commands: You have full control over what component executes the command.

* Editor specific commands: You can use the editor-specific command definitions (example: `tasks.json` and `launch.json` in Che-Theia, which is equivalent to how these files work in VS Code).

=== {prod-short}-specific commands

Each {prod-short}-specific command features:

 * An `actions` attribute that specifies a command to execute.
 * A `component` attribute that specifies the container in which to execute the command.
 
The commands are run using the default shell in the container.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
projects:
  - name: my-go-project
    clonePath: go/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project
    source:
      type: git
      location: https://github.com/acme/my-go-project.git
components:
  - type: dockerimage
    image: golang
    alias: go-cli
    memoryLimit: 512Mi
    mountSources: true
    command: ['sleep', 'infinity']
    env:
      - name: GOPATH
        value: $(CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT)/go
      - name: GOCACHE
        value: /tmp/go-cache
commands:
  - name: compile and run
    actions:
     - type: exec
       component: go-cli
       command: “go get -d && go run main.go”
       workdir: “${CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT}/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project”
----

[NOTE]
====
* If a component to be used in a command must have an alias. This alias is used to reference the component in the command definition. Example: `alias: go-cli` in the component definition and `component: go-cli` in the command definition. This ensures that {prod} can find the correct container to run the command in.

* A command can have only one action.
====

=== Editor-specific commands

If the editor in the workspace supports it, the devfile can specify additional configuration in the editor-specific format. This is dependent on the integration code present in the workspace editor itself and so is not a generic mechanism. However, the default Che-Theia editor within {prod} is equipped to understand the `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files provided in the devfile.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: MyDevfile
projects:
  - name: my-go-project
    clonePath: go/src/github.com/acme/my-go-project
    source:
      type: git
      location: https://github.com/acme/my-go-project.git
commands:
  - name: tasks
    actions:
      - type: vscode-task
        referenceContent: >
            {
                "version": "2.0.0",
                "tasks": [
                    {
                        "label": "create test file",
                        "type": "shell",
                        "command": "touch ${workspaceFolder}/test.file"
                    }
                ]
            }
----

This example shows association of a `tasks.json` file with a devfile. Notice the `vscode-task` type that instructs the Che-Theia editor to interpret this command as a tasks definition and `referenceContent` attribute that contains the contents of the file itself. You can also save this file separately from the devfile and use `reference` attribute to specify a relative or absolute URL to it.

In addition to the `vscode-task` commands, the Che-Theia editor understands `vscode-launch` type using which you can specify the start configurations.

=== Command preview URL

It is possible to specify a preview URL for commands that expose web UI. This URL is offered for opening when the command is executed.

[source,yaml]
----
commands:
    - name: tasks
      previewUrl:
        port: 8080     <1>
        path: /myweb   <2>
      actions:
      - type: exec
        component: go-cli
        command: "go run webserver.go"
        workdir: ${CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT}/webserver
----
<1> TCP port where the application listens. Mandatory parameter.
<2> The path part of the URL to the UI. Optional parameter. The default is root (`/`).

The example above opens `++http://__<server-domain>__/myweb++`, where `_<server-domain>_` is the URL to the dynamically created {platforms-ingress}.

==== Setting the default way of opening preview URLs

By default, a notification that asks the user about the URL opening preference is displayed. 

To specify the preferred way of previewing a service URL:

. Open {prod-short} preferences in *File -> Settings -> Open Preferences* and find `che.task.preview.notifications` in the *{prod-short}* section.

. Choose from the list of possible values:
+
* `on` -- enables a notification for asking the user about the URL opening preferences
* `alwaysPreview` -- the preview URL opens automatically in the *Preview* panel as soon as a task is running
* `alwaysGoTo` -- the preview URL opens automatically in a separate browser tab as soon as a task is running
* `off` -- disables opening the preview URL (automatically and with a notification)


== Adding attributes to a devfile

Devfile attributes can be used to configure various features.

[id="attribute-editorfree_{context}"]
=== Attribute: editorFree

When an editor is not specified in a devfile, a default is provided. When no editor is needed, use the `editorFree` attribute. The default value of `false` means that the devfile requests the provisioning of the default editor.

.Example of a devfile without an editor
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: 1.0.0
metadata:
  name: petclinic-dev-environment
components:
  - alias: myApp
    type: kubernetes
    reference: my-app.yaml
attributes:
  editorFree: true
----

=== Attribute: persistVolumes (ephemeral mode)

By default, volumes and PVCs specified in a devfile are bound to a host folder to persist data even after a container restart. To disable data persistence to make the workspace faster, such as when the volume back end is slow, modify the `persistVolumes` attribute in the devfile. The default value is `true`. Set to `false` to use `emptyDir` for configured volumes and PVC.

.Example of a devfile with ephemeral mode enabled

----
apiVersion: 1.0.0

    source:
      type: git
      location: 'https://github.com/che-samples/web-java-spring-petclinic.git'
attributes:
  persistVolumes: false
----

=== Attribute: asyncPersist (asynchronous storage)

When `persistVolumes` is set to `false` (see above), the additional attribute `asyncPersist` can be set to `true` to enable asynchronous storage. See xref:installation-guide:configuring-storage-types.adoc[] for more details.

      type: git
      location: 'https://github.com/che-samples/web-java-spring-petclinic.git'
attributes:
  persistVolumes: false
  asyncPersist: true
----

=== Attribute: mergePlugins

This property can be set to manually control how plugins are included in the workspace. When the property `mergePlugins` is set to `true`, Che will attempt to avoid running multiple instances of the same container by combining plugins. The default value when this property is not included in a devfile is governed by the Che configuration property `che.workspace.plugin_broker.default_merge_plugins`; adding the `mergePlugins: false` attribute to a devfile will disable plugin merging for that workspace.
