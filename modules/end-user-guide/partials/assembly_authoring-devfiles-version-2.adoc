.Procedure
//TODO - Figure out whether we want to duplicate, single source or just reference devfile docs here

* Follow the instructions in the link:https://docs.devfile.io/devfile/2.0.0/user-guide/authoring-stacks.html[Devfile User Guide].

.Additional resources

* For more information about devfile object schema and object properties, see the link:https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/devfile[Introduction to Devfiles].
