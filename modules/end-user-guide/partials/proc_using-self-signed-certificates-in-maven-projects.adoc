= Using self-signed certificates in Maven projects

Internal artifact repositories often do not have a certificate signed by an authority that is trusted by default in Java. They are mainly signed by an internal company authority or are self-signed. Configure your tools to accept these certificates by adding them to the Java truststore.

.Procedure

. Obtain a server certificate file from the repository server. It is customary for administrators to provide certificates of internal artifact servers as {orch-name} secrets (see xref:installation-guide:importing-untrusted-tls-certificates.adoc[]). The relevant server certificates will be mounted in `/public-certs` in every container in the workspace.

.. Copy the original Java truststore file:
+
----
$ mkdir /projects/maven
$ cp $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts /projects/maven/truststore.jks
$ chmod +w /projects/maven/truststore.jks
----
+
.. Import the certificate into the Java truststore file
+
----
$ keytool -import -noprompt -file /public-certs/nexus.cer -alias nexus -keystore /projects/maven/truststore.jks -storepass changeit
Certificate was added to keystore

----
+
. Add the truststore file.
+
* In the Maven container:
+
.. Add the `javax.net.ssl` system property to the `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  - mountSources: true
    alias: maven
    type: dockerimage
    ...
    env:
       -name: MAVEN_OPTS
        value: >-
          -Duser.home=/projects/maven -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/projects/maven/truststore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit
----
+
.. Restart the workspace.
+
* In the Java plug-in container:
+
In the devfile, add the `javax.net.ssl` system property for the Java language server:
+
[source,yaml]
