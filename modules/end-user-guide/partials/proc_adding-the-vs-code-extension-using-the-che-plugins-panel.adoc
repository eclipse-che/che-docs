= Adding a VS Code extension using the *{prod-short} Plugins* panel

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}. To install an instance of {prod-short}, see {link-installing-an-instance}.
* The VS Code extension is available in the {prod-short} plug-in registry, or metadata for the VS Code extension are available. See xref:publishing-metadata-for-a-vs-code-extension.adoc[].

.Procedure

To add a VS Code extension using the *{prod-short} Plugins* panel:

. Open the *{prod-short} Plugins* panel by pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+J` or navigate to *View -> Plugins*.

. Change the current registry to the registry in which the VS Code extension was added.

. In the search bar, click the *Menu* button and then click *Change Registry* to choose the registry from the list. If the required registry is not in the list, add it using the *Add Registry* menu option. The registry link points to the `plugins` segment of the registry, for example: `+https://my-registry.com/v3/plugins/index.json+`.

. To update the list of plug-ins after adding a new registry link, use `Refresh` command from the search bar menu.

. Search for the required plug-in using the filter, and then click the btn:[Install] button.
. Restart the workspace for the changes to take effect.
