{prod-short} commands:: `Package Native App` and `Start Native App`
+
The {prod-short} commands are to be used to define tasks that will be executed in the workspace container.
+
* The `exec` type implies that the {prod-short} runner is used for command execution. The user can specify the component in whose container the command is executed.
* The `command` field contains the command line for execution.
* The `workdir` is the working directory in which the command is executed.
* The `component` field refers to the container where the command will be executed. The field contains the component `alias` where the container is defined.

VS Code `launch` configurations:: `Attach remote debugger`
+
VS Code `launch` configurations are commonly used to define debugging configuration. To trigger these configurations, press btn:[F5] or choose *Start Debugging* from the *Debug* menu. The configurations provide information to the debugger, such as the port to connect to for debugging or the type of the application to debug (Node.js, Java, and others.).
+
* The type is `vscode-launch`.
* It contains the `launch` configurations in the VS Code format.
* For more information about VS Code `launch` configurations, see the Debugging section on the link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations[Visual Studio documentation page].

Tasks of type `che`, also known as `exec` commands, can be executed from the *Terminal->Run Task* menu or by selecting them in the *My Workspace* panel. Other tasks are only available from *Terminal->Run Task*. Configurations to start with are available in the Che-Theia debugger.
