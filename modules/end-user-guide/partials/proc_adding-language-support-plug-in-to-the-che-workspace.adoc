= Adding a language support plug-in to a {prod-short} workspace

This procedure describes adding a tool to a created workspace by enabling a dedicated plug-in from the Dashboard.

This procedure uses the Language Support for Java plug-ins as an example.

.Prerequisites

* A running instance of {prod-short}.
+
To install an instance of {prod-short}, see {link-installing-an-instance}.

* A created workspace that is defined in this instance of {prod}
+
To define a workspace, see the following resources:
** xref:configuring-a-workspace-with-dashboard.adoc[Configuring a {prod-short} {prod-ver} workspace]
** xref:creating-a-workspace-from-included-options.adoc#creating-a-workspace-from-workspace-sample_{context}[Creating a workspace from workspace sample]

 * The workspace must be in a **stopped** state.
 +
 To stop a workspace:
 //Is there a different section that describes this procedure? max-cx
.. Navigate to the {prod-short} Dashboard, as explained in xref:navigating-che-using-the-dashboard.adoc[].
.. In the *Dashboard*, click the *Workspaces* menu to open the workspaces list and locate the workspace.
.. On the same row with the displayed workspace, on the right side of the screen, click btn:[Stop] to stop the workspace.
.. Wait a few seconds for the workspace to stop, and then configure the workspace by selecting it.

.Procedure

To add a plug-in from the Plug-in registry to a created {prod-short} workspace, install the plug-in as follows by adding content to the devfile:

. Navigate to the *Devfile* tab, where the devfile YAML is displayed.
. In the `components` section of the devfile, add the following lines to add the Java 8 language plugin to the workspace:
+
include::example${project-context}-java-language-support.adoc[]
+
An example of the final result:
+
include::example${project-context}-workspace-from-the-php-stack-java-language-support.adoc[]
. Click btn:[Save] to save the changes.
. Restart the workspace.
. Verify that the workspace now includes the new plug-in.
