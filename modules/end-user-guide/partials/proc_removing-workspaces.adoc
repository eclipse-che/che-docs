= Removing workspaces

You can remove a workspace by simply deleting the `DevWorkspace` custom resource.

WARNING: Deleting the `DevWorkspace` custom resource will also delete other workspace resources if they were created by {prod-short}: for example, the referenced `DevWorkspaceTemplate` and per-workspace `PersistentVolumeClaims`.

TIP: Remove workspaces by using the {prod-short} dashboard whenever possible.

.Prerequisites

* An active `{orch-cli}` session on the cluster. See {orch-cli-link}.

* You know the workspace name.
+
[TIP]
====
You can find the relevant workspace name in the output of `$ {orch-cli} get devworkspaces`.
====

* You know the relevant {prod-short} user namespace on the cluster.
+
TIP: You can visit `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]/api/kubernetes/namespace` to get your {prod-short} user namespace as `name`.

* You are in the {prod-short} user namespace on the cluster.
+
[TIP]
====
On OpenShift, you can use the command-line `oc` tool to link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/developer-cli-commands.html#oc-project[display your current namespace or switch to a namespace].
