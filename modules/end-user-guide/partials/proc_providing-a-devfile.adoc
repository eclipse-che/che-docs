= Providing a devfile

Providing a link:https://devfile.io/[devfile] in the root directory of the repository is recommended to define the development environment of the workspace created by the factory URL.
In this way, the workspace contains everything users need to review pull requests, such as plugins, development commands, and other environment setup.

The link:https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs/blob/main/devfile.yaml[Che documentation repository devfile] is an example of a well-defined and effective devfile.
