= Checking the YAML language server feature flags

.Procedure

To check the feature flags:

. Check if the features are enabled. The YAML plug-in provides multiple settings that can enable and disable features, such as:
+
* `yaml.format.enable`: Enables the formatter
* `yaml.validate`: Enables validation
* `yaml.hover`: Enables the hover function
* `yaml.completion`: Enables the completion function

. To check if the plug-in is working, type the simplest YAML, such as `hello: world`, and then open the *Outline* panel on the right side of the editor.

. Verify if there are any document symbols. If yes, the language server is connected to the editor.

. If any feature is not working, verify that the settings listed above are set to `true` (they are set to `true` by default). If a feature is not working, file an issue against the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server[Language Server].
