= Authenticating on Bitbucket servers

Bitbucket authentication is based on using personal access tokens. Each Bitbucket user is able to request several personal access tokens with different names, permissions, expiration times, and so on. Those tokens can be used to sign Bitbucket REST API calls and perform Git repository operations.

{prod-short} users may use public or private repositories on the Bitbucket SCM (Source Code Management) system as a source of their projects.

The use of private repositories requires the additional configuration described below.

.Prerequisites

. xref:administration-guide:configuring-authorization#configuring_bitbucket_servers_{context}[Configuring Bitbucket servers]

. xref:administration-guide:configuring-authorization#proc_configuring-bitbucket-server-oauth1_{context}[Configuring Bitbucket Server OAuth 1]



.Procedure

. Obtain a user ID from a secret using a call to a REST API URL:

* For Bitbucket:
+
[subs="+quotes,macros"]
----
++https++://__<bitbucket-hostname>__/rest/api/1.0/users/__<username>__
----

* For {prod-short}:
+
[subs="+macros,attributes"]
----
{prod-url}/api/user
----

NOTE: With the token credentials obtained from the secret, another secret is automatically created. This second secret is mounted into a workspace container as a Git credentials file allowing authorization to Git operations. The BB private Git repositories configuration is then complete.

To allow Bitbucket authentication on the {prod-short} side, personal tokens must be stored in the user's {orch-namespace} in the form of a secret. The secret must look as follows:

include::example$snip_bitbucket-personal-access-token-secret.adoc[]

The main parts of the secret are:

[cols=3*]
|===
| <1> Label
| `app.kubernetes.io/component`
| Indicates it is an SCM personal token secret. 

| <2> Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/che-userid`
| {prod} id of the user token belongs to.

| <3> Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/scm-userid`
| Bitbucket user id to which token belongs.

| <4> Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/scm-username`
| Bitbucket user name to which token belongs.

| <5> Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/scm-url`
| Bitbucket server URL to which this token belongs.

| <6> Annotation
| `che.eclipse.org/expired-after`
| Personal access token expiration time (UNIX).

| <7> Data entry
| `token`
| Base-64 encoded value of the personal access token. Example:TlRnNE1UazRORFl5TWpNeU9sMTI1aDFFT2dRbXBlTUYvbmhiLzNQUC9hT08=

|===

NOTE: Encoding a string into the base64 format using the `base64` tool on Linux machines leads to adding the newline character to the end of the source string and causing a value to be unusable as the authentication header value after decoding. Avoid this by using `base64 -w0`, which removes newly added lines, or strip newlines explicitly using`tr -d \\n`.

.Additional resources

* When a remote Git repository uses a self-signed certificate, add an additional server configuration. See xref:installation-guide:deploying-che-with-support-for-git-repositories-with-self-signed-certificates.adoc[].
