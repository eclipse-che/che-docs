You can create a new workspace by using one of the devfile templates included in {prod-short}.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not enter a *Workspace Name* for your workspace, {prod-short} generates a unique name for a new workspace from the devfile's `metadata.generateName` property followed by four random characters.
====

. Click btn:[Create & Open].

. Wait for the initialized workspace to start and for the IDE to open.
