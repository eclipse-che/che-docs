When installed in a workspace, {prod-short} plug-ins bring new capabilities to {prod-short}. Plug-ins consist of a Che-Theia plug-in, metadata, and a hosting container. These plug-ins may provide the following capabilities:

* Integrating with other systems, including {platforms-name}.
* Automating some developer tasks, such as formatting, refactoring, and running automated tests.
* Communicating with multiple databases directly from the IDE.
* Enhanced code navigation, auto-completion, and error highlighting.

This chapter provides basic information about installing, enabling, and using {prod-short} plug-ins in workspaces.
