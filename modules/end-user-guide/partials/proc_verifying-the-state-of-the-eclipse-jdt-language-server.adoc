= Verifying the state of the Eclipse JDT Language Server

.Procedure

Check if the container that is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server main process.

. Open a terminal in the container that is running the Eclipse JDT Language Server plug-in (an example name for the container: `vscode-javaxxx`).

. Inside the terminal, run the `ps aux | grep jdt` command to check if the Eclipse JDT Language Server process is running in the container. If the process is running, the output is:
+
----
usr/lib/jvm/default-jvm/bin/java --add-modules=ALL-SYSTEM --add-opens java.base/java.util
----
+
This message also shows the VSCode Java extension used. If it is not running, the language server has not been started inside the container.

. Check all logs described in xref:viewing-che-workspaces-logs.adoc#checking-important-logs_{context}[Checking important logs]
