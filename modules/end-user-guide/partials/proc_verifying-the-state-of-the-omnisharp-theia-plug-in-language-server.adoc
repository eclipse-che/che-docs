= Verifying the state of the OmniSharp-Theia plug-in language server

.Procedure

To check if the container running the OmniSharp-Theia plug-in is running OmniSharp, execute the `ps aux | grep OmniSharp.exe` command. If the process is running, the following is an example output:

----
/tmp/theia-unpacked/redhat-developer.che-omnisharp-plugin.0.0.1.zcpaqpczwb.omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia/server/bin/mono
/tmp/theia-unpacked/redhat-developer.che-omnisharp-plugin.0.0.1.zcpaqpczwb.omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia/server/omnisharp/OmniSharp.exe
----

If the output is different, the language server has not started inside the container. Check the logs described in xref:viewing-che-workspaces-logs.adoc[].
