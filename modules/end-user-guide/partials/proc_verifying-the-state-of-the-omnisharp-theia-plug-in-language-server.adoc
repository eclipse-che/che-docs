= Verifying the state of the Omnisharp-Theia plug-in language server

.Procedure

To check if the container running the Omnisharp-Theia plug-in is running OmniSharp, execute the `ps aux | grep OmniSharp.exe` command. If the process is running, the following is an example output:

----
/tmp/theia-unpacked/redhat-developer.che-omnisharp-plugin.0.0.1.zcpaqpczwb.omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia/server/bin/mono
/tmp/theia-unpacked/redhat-developer.che-omnisharp-plugin.0.0.1.zcpaqpczwb.omnisharp_theia_plugin.theia/server/omnisharp/OmniSharp.exe
----

If the output is different, the language server has not started inside the container. Check the logs described in link:#checking-important-logs_viewing-logs-from-language-servers-and-debug-adapters[Checking important logs].
