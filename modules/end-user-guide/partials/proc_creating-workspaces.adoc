= Creating workspaces

If your use case does not permit use of the {prod-short} dashboard, you can create workspaces with {orch-name} APIs by applying custom resources to the cluster.

[NOTE]
====

Creating workspaces through the {prod-short} dashboard provides better user experience and configuration benefits compared to using the command line:

* As a user, you are automatically logged in to the cluster.
* {platforms-name} clients work automatically.
* {prod-short} and its components automatically convert the target Git repository's devfile into the `DevWorkspace` and `DevWorkspaceTemplate` custom resources on the cluster.
* Access to the workspace is secured by default with the `routingClass: che` in the `DevWorkspace` of the workspace.
* Recognition of the `DevWorkspaceOperatorConfig` configuration is managed by {prod-short}.
* Recognition of configurations in `spec.devEnvironments` specified in the `CheCluster` custom resource including:
** Persistent storage strategy is specified with `devEnvironments.storage`.
** Default IDE is specified with `devEnvironments.defaultEditor`.
** Default plugins are specified with `devEnvironments.defaultPlugins`.
** Container build configuration is specified with `devEnvironments.containerBuildConfiguration`.

====

.Prerequisites

* An active `{orch-cli}` session with permissions to create `DevWorkspace` resources in your {orch-namespace} on the cluster. See {orch-cli-link}.

* You know the relevant {prod-short} user namespace on the cluster.
+
TIP: You can visit `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}]/api/kubernetes/namespace` to get your {prod-short} user namespace as `name`.

* You are in the {prod-short} user namespace on the cluster.

[TIP]
====
On OpenShift, you can use the command-line `oc` tool to link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/developer-cli-commands.html#oc-project[display your current namespace or switch to a namespace].
====
+
NOTE: {prod-short} administrators who intend to create workspaces for other users must create the `DevWorkspace` custom resource in a user namespace that is provisioned by {prod-short} or by the administrator. See xref:administration-guide:configuring-namespace-provisioning.adoc[].

.Procedure

. To prepare the `DevWorkspace` custom resource, copy the contents of the target Git repository's devfile.
+
.Copied devfile contents with `schemaVersion: 2.2.0`

TIP: For more details, see the link:https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/what-is-a-devfile[devfile v2 documentation].

. Create a `DevWorkspace` custom resource, pasting the devfile contents from the previous step under the `spec.template` field.

<1> Name of the `DevWorkspace` custom resource. This will be the name of the new workspace.
<2> User namespace, which is the target {orch-namespace} for the new workspace.
<3> Determines whether the workspace must be started when the `DevWorkspace` custom resource is created.
<4> URL reference to the link:https://github.com/microsoft/vscode[Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source] IDE devfile from the plugin registry.
<5> Details about the Git repository to clone into the workspace when it starts.
<6> List of components such as workspace containers and volume components.
====

. Apply the `DevWorkspace` custom resource to the cluster.

.Verification
. Verify that the workspace is starting by checking the *PHASE* status of the `DevWorkspace`.

You can then open the workspace by using one of these options:

** Visit the URL provided in the *INFO* section of the output of the `{orch-cli} get devworkspaces` command.
** Open the workspace from the {prod-short} dashboard.
