= Using self-signed certificates in Python projects

Internal artifact repositories often do not have a self-signed TLS certificate signed by an authority that is trusted by default. They are mainly signed by an internal company authority or are self-signed. Configure your tools to accept these certificates.

Python uses certificates from a file defined in the `PIP_CERT` environment variable.

.Procedure

. Obtain the certificate used by the pip server in the Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format. It is customary for administrators to provide certificates of internal artifact servers as {orch-name} secrets (see xref:installation-guide:importing-untrusted-tls-certificates.adoc[]). The relevant server certificates will be mounted in `/public-certs` in every container in the workspace.

[NOTE]
====
pip accepts certificates in the Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format only. Convert the certificate to the PEM format using OpenSSL if necessary.
