= Additional tools in the {prod-short} workspace

{prod-short} plug-ins are extensions to the Che-Theia IDE that come bundled with container images. These images contain the native prerequisites of their respective extensions. For example, the OpenShift command-line tool is bundled with a command to install it, which ensures the proper functionality of the OpenShift Connector plug-in, all available in the dedicated image.

Plug-ins can also include metadata to define a description, categorization tags, and an icon. {prod-short} provides a registry of plug-ins available for installation into the user's workspace.

The Che-Theia IDE is generally compatible with the VS Code extensions API and VS Code extensions are automatically compatible with Che-Theia. These extensions are possible to package as {prod-short} plug-ins by combining them with their dependencies. By default, {prod-short} includes a plug-in registry containing common plug-ins.

* Using the Dashboard: 
** Add a plug-in directly into a devfile using the *Devfile* tab.

The devfile can also further the plug-in configuration, such as defining memory or CPU consumption.

* Using the Che-Theia IDE:
** By pressing kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+J] or by navigating to *View -> Plugins*.
