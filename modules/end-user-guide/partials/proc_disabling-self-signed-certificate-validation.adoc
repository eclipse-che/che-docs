= Disabling self-signed certificate validation

Run the command below to disable SSL, which will bypass validation of your self-signed certificates. Note that this is a potential security risk. For a better solution, configure use of a self-signed certificate you trust with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. 

.Procedure

* Run the following command in the terminal:
+
[source, yaml]
----
npm config set strict-ssl false
