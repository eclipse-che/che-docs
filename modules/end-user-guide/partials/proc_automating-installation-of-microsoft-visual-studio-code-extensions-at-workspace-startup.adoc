= Automating installation of Microsoft Visual Studio Code extensions at workspace startup

To have the Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source IDE automatically install chosen extensions, you can add an `extensions.json` file to the remote Git repository that contains your project source code and that will be cloned into workspaces.

.Prerequisites
* The public OpenVSX registry at link:https://open-vsx.org[open-vsx.org] is selected and accessible over the internet. See xref:administration-guide:extensions-for-microsoft-visual-studio-code-open-source.adoc[Selecting an Open VSX registry instance].
+
[TIP]
====
To install recommended extensions in a restricted environment, consider the following options instead:

* xref:administration-guide:configuring-the-open-vsx-registry-url.adoc[] to point to your OpenVSX registry.

* xref:defining-a-common-ide.adoc[].

* link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix[Installing extensions from VSX files].

.Procedure

. Get the publisher and extension names of each chosen extension:

.. Find the extension on the link:https://www.open-vsx.org/[Open VSX registry website] and copy the URL of the extension's listing page.

.. Extract the __<publisher>__ and __<extension>__ names from the copied URL:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
https://www.open-vsx.org/extension/__<publisher>__/__<extension>__
----

. Create a `.vscode/extensions.json` file in the remote Git repository.

. Add the __<publisher>__ and __<extension>__ names to the `extensions.json` file as follows:
+
[source,json,subs="+quotes"]
----
  {
    "recommendations": [
      "__<publisher_A>__.__<extension_B>__",
      "__<publisher_C>__.__<extension_D>__",
      "__<publisher_E>__.__<extension_F>__"
    ]
  }
----

.Verification

. xref:starting-a-workspace-from-a-git-repository-url.adoc[Start a new workspace by using the URL of the remote Git repository] that contains the created `extensions.json` file.
. In the IDE of the workspace, press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+X] or go to *Extensions* to find each of the extensions listed in the file.
. The extension has the label *This extension is enabled globally*.
