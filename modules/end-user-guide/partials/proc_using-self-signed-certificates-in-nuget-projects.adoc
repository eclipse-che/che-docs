= Using self-signed certificates in NuGet projects

Internal artifact repositories often do not have a self-signed TLS certificate signed by an authority that is trusted by default. They are mainly signed by an internal company authority or are self-signed. Configure your tools to accept these certificates.

.Procedure

. Obtain the certificate used by the .NET server in the Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format. It is customary for administrators to provide certificates of internal artifact servers as {orch-name} secrets (see xref:installation-guide:importing-untrusted-tls-certificates.adoc[]). The relevant server certificates will be mounted in `/public-certs` in every container in the workspace.

. Specify the location of the certificate file in the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable in your devfile for the OmniSharp plug-in and for the .NET container.
