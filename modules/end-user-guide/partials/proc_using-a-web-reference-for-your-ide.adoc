=== Using a web reference for your IDE

Rather than pointing to a plug-in in your plug-in registry, you can point at a YAML file directly with the `reference` directive.

.Procedure

* Set a `reference` directive in your `che-editor.yaml` file:
+
```
reference: https://gist.github.com/.../che-editor.yaml # mandatory
override:                                              # optional
  containers:
      - name: theia-ide
        memoryLimit: 1280Mi 
```
