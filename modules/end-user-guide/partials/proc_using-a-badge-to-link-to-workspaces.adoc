= Using a badge to link to workspaces

It is common for code repositories to display badges in their `README` files that describe various aspects of the project, such as its test coverage, latest build status, link to documentation, and other things. For example, the {prod-short} GitHub `README` has the following badges:

image::workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png[link="../_images/workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png"]

To make the process of using {prod-short} easier, the following badge is available: image:https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg[Factory Badge]

Use this badge and link it to a {prod-short} instance to quickly open a developer workspace.


== Including the developer workspace badge in a README

.Procedure

Add a link to your repository in the project `README` file. Using link:https://workspaces.openshift.com[workspaces.openshift.com] as an example {prod-short} host, and a GitHub repository:

----
[![Contribute](https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg)](https://workspaces.openshift.com/#__<repository-url>__)
----

The snippet above creates a badge that opens a developer workspace of the repository at `+https://github.com/org/repository+` in link:https://workspaces.openshift.com/[workspaces.openshift.com]. To open a workspace in your {prod-short} installation, substitute your URL and repository:

----
[![Contribute](https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg)](https://your-che-host.com/#__<repository-url>__)
