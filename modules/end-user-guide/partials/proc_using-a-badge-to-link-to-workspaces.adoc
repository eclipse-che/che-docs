= Using a badge to link to workspaces

It is common for code repositories to display badges in their `README` files that describe various aspects of the project, such as its test coverage, latest build status, link to documentation, and other things. For example, the {prod-short} GitHub `README` has the following badges:

image::workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png[link="../_images/workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png"]

To make the process of using {prod-short} easier, the following badge is available: image:https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg[Factory Badge]

Use this badge and link it to a {prod-short} instance to quickly open a developer workspace.


== Including the developer workspace badge in a README

.Procedure

. To open a workspace in your {prod-short} installation, substitute your URL and repository:
+

[![Contribute](https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg)](https://your-che-host.com/f?url=https://your-repository-url)
----

. Add the link to your repository in the project `README` file.

.Example: Using link:https://workspaces.openshift.com[workspaces.openshift.com] as the {prod-short} host and a GitHub repository

The following snippet creates a badge that opens a developer workspace of the repository at `+https://github.com/org/repository+` in link:https://workspaces.openshift.com/[workspaces.openshift.com]:
