{prod} is an extensible and customizable developer-workspaces platform.

You can extend {prod} in three different ways:

* *Alternative IDEs* provide specialized tools for {prod}. For example, a Jupyter notebook for data analysis. Alternate IDEs can be based on Eclipse Theia or any other IDE (web or desktop based). The default IDE in {prod} is Che-Theia.

* *Che-Theia plug-ins* add capabilities to the Che-Theia IDE. They rely on plug-in APIs that are compatible with Visual Studio Code. The plug-ins are isolated from the IDE itself. They can be packaged as files or as containers to provide their own dependencies.

* *Stacks* are pre-configured {prod-short} workspaces with a dedicated set of tools, which cover different developer personas. For example, it is possible to pre-configure a workbench for a tester with only the tools needed for their purposes.

A user can extend {prod-short} by using `self-hosted` mode, which {prod-short} provides by default.
