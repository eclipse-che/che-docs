* *Menus, panels, and commands:* Add your own items to the IDE components.
* *Themes:* Build custom themes, extend the UI, or customize icon themes.
* *Snippets, code formatting, and syntax highlighting:* Enhance comfort of use with supported programming languages.
* *Keybindings:* Add new keyboard mapping and popular keybindings to make the environment feel natural.
