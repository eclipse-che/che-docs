.Example - Adding a `.git` project into a workspace using a devfile
+
In the following instance, the project `{project-context}` acts as the example of a user's project. A user specifies this project using the `name` attribute of a devfile. The `location` attribute defines the source repository represented by an URL to a Git repository or zip archive.
+  
To add a project into the workspace, add or edit the following section:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,macros,attributes"]
----
projects:
  - name: __<{project-context}>__
    source:
      type: git
      location: 'https://github.com/__<github-organization>__/__<{project-context}>__.git'
