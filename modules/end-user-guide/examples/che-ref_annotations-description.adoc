* `che.eclipse.org/automount-workspace-secret`: *_Introduced in the version 7.15_*. The main mount selector. When set to `true`, the secret mounts into all user's containers of the {prod-short} workspace. When set to `false`, the secret does not mount into containers by default. The value of this attribute can be overridden in devfile components, using the `automountWorkspaceSecrets` boolean property that gives more flexibility to workspace owners. This property requires an `alias` to be defined for the component that uses it.

* `che.eclipse.org/mount-as`: Describes if a secret will be mounted as an environmental variable or a file. Options: `env` or `file`.

* `che.eclipse.org/_<mykeyName>_-env-name: FOO_ENV`: The name of the environment variable used when data contains multiple items. `mykeyName` is used as an example.

* `che.eclipse.org/git-credential: 'true'`: The flag indicates that the secret contains Git credential file.
