== URLs for starting a new workspace

For every remote Git repository that you plan to use inside a workspace, you need a URL with the following syntax:
[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
{prod-url}#__<Git_repository_URL>__
----

Visiting this URL in a browser tab starts a new workspace that contains a clone of that repository.
