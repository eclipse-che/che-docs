= Starting a new workspace with a clone of a Git repository

With {prod-short}, you can start a new workspace that contains a clone of a Git repository. So you can have your remote origin or fork cloned into a new starting workspace. Or you can have a common repository of a project cloned into a new starting workspace. With such Git providers as GitHub and GitLab, you can also specify the branch for the new starting workspace to checkout.

NOTE: Advanced users can compose and use their own devfiles, as well as use a local devfile.
//provide links on "compose", "devfiles", and "local devfile" to the corresponding sections in Advanced Use (User Guide). max-cx
