= Starting a new workspace with a clone of a Git repository

With {prod-short}, you can start a new workspace that contains a clone of a Git repository. So you can have your remote origin or fork cloned into a new starting workspace. Or you can have a common repository of a project cloned into a new starting workspace. With such Git providers as GitHub and GitLab, you can also specify the branch for the new starting workspace to checkout.

TIP: Advanced users can compose and use their own devfiles, as well as use a local devfile.
//provide links on "compose", "devfiles", and "local devfile" to the corresponding sections in Advanced Use (User Guide). max-cx

IMPORTANT: Although the devfile enables the full functionality of a workspace, you can also start a new workspace by supplying the URL of a Git repository without a devfile. This results in a new workspace with a clone of the Git repository and with the defaults such as the Che-Theia IDE and the Universal Developer Image.
//provide xrefs to a concept module about the Universal Developer Image and, if applicable, devfile-less defaults for new workspaces. max-cx

NOTE: The *Create Workspace* page of your {prod-short} xref:url-of-your-che-dashboard.adoc[dashboard] has the *Git Repo URL ** field as the GUI alternative for entering the URL of a Git repository to start a new workspace.

.Prerequisites

* Your organization has a running instance of {prod-short}.
* You have been given the xref:url-of-your-organizations-che-instance.adoc[].
* Your Git repository maintainer keeps the `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` file in the root directory of the Git repository.

.Procedure

. Optional: visit the xref:url-of-your-che-dashboard.adoc[] to log in as a {prod-short} user to your organization's instance of {prod-short}.

. Visit the xref:urls-for-starting-a-new-workspace.adoc[URL to start a new workspace].
+
A new tab opens with the workspace-starting page in *Progress*.
+
When the new workspace is ready, the workspace user interface loads in the browser tab.
+
A clone of the Git repository is present in the filesystem of the new workspace.
