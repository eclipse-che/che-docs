= URL parameter for workspace IDE

Che-Theia is currently the default integrated development environment (IDE) that a workspace loads with if no IDE is specified as a URL parameter as part of the link:starting-a-new-workspace-with-a-clone-of-a-git-repository.adoc[URL for starting a new workspace].

The URL parameter for the link:starting-a-new-workspace-with-a-clone-of-a-git-repository.adoc[URL for starting a new workspace] to specify another supported IDE is `che-editor=__<editor_key>__`. The link:starting-a-new-workspace-with-a-clone-of-a-git-repository.adoc[URL for starting a new workspace] has the following syntax with the `che-editor=__<editor_key>__` parameter:

[source,subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
{prod-url}#__<git_repository_url>__?che-editor=__<editor_key>__ <1>
----
<1> `__<editor_key>__` is one of the following values:
