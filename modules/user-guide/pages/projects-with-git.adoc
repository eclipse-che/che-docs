//CONCEPT MODULE THAT DISCUSSES PROJECTS THAT USE GIT, HOW WORKSPACES CAN HELP, AND SUMMARIZES THE NEXT PROCEDURES
//including a mention of the requirement that "The repository is available over HTTPS." (this doesn't need to be in the prerequisites (it's something that should be set up, so the user shouldn't worry about it), preferably move it elsewhere in the module)

MENTION THE FOLLOWING HERE (AND DON'T MENTION IT IN THE PROCS OR PROC HEADINGS:
* a workspace that contains a clone of a Git repository
* Your administrator maintains the `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` file in the root directory of the Git repository.
//Here maybe provide a link to the relevant procedure in the Administration Guide

//PARTS OF THIS CAN BE DUPLICATED OR SHARE BETWEEN PROJECTS WITH GIT AND PROJECTS WITHOUT GIT:
//IS THIS FOR HERE OR FOR THE ASSEMBLY/CONCEPT SECTION (PROJECTS WITH GIT): Here i need to explain when and how often the user is expected to need (create) new workspaces, which includes that conversely i also need to explain when and how often the user can stop and restart the user's existing workspaces. Although getting a new workspace it quick and simple for the user, there are situation when the user should preferably stick (reopen, restart, etc.) to an existing workspace.
//some inspirations for describing the https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/shell-workspaces.html.en
//"Workspaces refer to the grouping of windows on your desktop. You can create multiple workspaces, which act like virtual desktops. Workspaces can be used to organize your work. For example, you could have all your communication windows, such as e-mail and your chat program, on one workspace, and the work you are doing on a different workspace. Your music manager could be on a third workspace."
//"What and Where Are Those Workspaces? A workspace is a clone of your desktop in different areas (or screens). You can then organize your desktop by moving different groups of applications to different screens."
//"Workspaces allow you to manage which windows are on your screen. You can imagine workspaces as being virtual screens, which you can switch between at any time. Every workspace contains the same desktop, the same panels, and the same menus. However, you can run different applications, and open different windows in each workspace. The applications in each workspace will remain there when you switch to other workspaces."
//"Tip Workspaces enable you to organize the GNOME Desktop when you run many applications at the same time. One way to use workspaces is to allocate a specific function to each workspace: one for email, one for web browsing, one for graphic design, etc. However, everyone has their own preference and you are in no way restricted to only using workspaces like this."

//MENTION THAT:
//1. THE USER CAN CLONE THE PROJECT'S REPOSITORY OR THE USER'S FORK OF IT
//2. THE USER CAN CLONE THE REPOSITORY FROM THE DEFAULT BRANCH OR FROM A FEATURE BRANCH
//NB: DOUBLE-CHECK (ASK AND TEST) THAT THE WHOLE REPOSITORY, NOT JUST ONE BRANCH, GETS CLONED

////
REUSE BY XREF AS MANY OF THE FOLLOWING MODULES AS POSSIBLE IN BOTH 'PROJECTS WITH GIT' AND 'PROJECTS WITHOUT GIT'
  LOG IN AS A USER (SHOULD EXPLAIN WHEN/HOW THE LOGIN PAGE APPEARS)
  ADD NEW WORKSPACE
TRY TO REUSE FOR BOTH 'PROJECTS WITH GIT' AND 'PROJECTS WITHOUT GIT':
  REOPEN AFTER (ACCIDENTALLY) CLOSING THE BROWSER TAB/WINDOW
  STOP
  RESTART/REOPEN?
  MODIFY? (DEVFILE?)
  DELETE/REMOVE
NB: other terms used in the equivalent procs in the old docs: execute a (new) workspace, run a (new) workspace.
