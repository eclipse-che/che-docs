With {prod-short}, you can also start a new workspace that contains a clone of a Git repository that has no devfile. The result is a new workspace with the defaults such as the Che-Theia IDE and the Universal Developer Image.

.Prerequisites

* Your organization has a running instance of {prod-short}.
* You have been given the xref:url-of-your-organizations-che-instance.adoc[].

.Procedure

. Go to the *Create Workspace* page of your {prod-short} xref:url-of-your-che-dashboard.adoc[dashboard].

. In the *Git Repo URL ** field, enter the URL of the Git repository that has no devfile.

. Click *Create and Open*.
+
A new tab opens with the workspace-starting page in *Progress*.
+
When the new workspace is ready, the workspace user interface loads in the browser tab.
+
A clone of the Git repository is present in the filesystem of the new workspace.
