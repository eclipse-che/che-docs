= Starting a stopped workspace

//REWRITE

//ADD A SENTENCE ABOUT THE STATUS UI ELEMENT OF EACH WORKSPACE UNDER *RECENT WORKSPACES*

You may stop your running workspace manually, or it may stop automatically due to reaching an idle timeout limit or a running timeout limit (as set by the administrator of your {prod-short} instance). In some cases, you may need to restart your workspace while it is still running.

To start a stopped workspace or restart a running workspace by using the dashboard:
*Progress* tab
Clicking on the workspace name (re)starts the workspace and opens a new browser tab with a page that shows the page tab with the overview points of the progress of starting the workspace.

.Procedure

A
If the workspace is stopped, and you visit the workspace link (as a browser bookmark), the workspace will start.

* Go to the workspace URL by clicking a bookmark or by entering the workspace URL in the address bar of your browser.

[TIP]
====
If you do not have the URL of the stopped workspace saved as a browser bookmark, you can start and open the workspace in a new tab by using the {prod-short} dashboard:
. Go to the {prod-short} dashboard.
. Go to *Workspaces*.
. Locate the workspace in the list.
. Go to *â‹®* *>* *Start in Background*.
. Click *Open*. This opens a new tab with the workspace.
