= ADDING A DEVFILE TO a Git repository

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IMPORTANT TO ADD:
////
this is in the context of the user procedure:
To start a workspace with a clone of a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository, go to your browser's address bar and enter the {prod-short} URL, prepended with a `#` character and appended with the repository link. Using the example of Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat: link:https://workspaces.openshift.com#https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server[].
Then {prod-short} starts a workspace and clones the repository `https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server`.
////
>>>>
{prod-short} also searches for a `.devfile.yaml` or `devfile.yaml` file in the given repository. The devfile describes the containers and commands to use for that project. Omitting this file will result in a default container. The default container provides different languages (including Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Golang, etc) and tools (including `curl`, `jq`, `yq`, etc).

MERGE:
* The `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` file is located in the root folder of a Git repository, on a specific branch of the user's choice that is accessible over HTTPS. See xref:authoring-devfiles-version-2.adoc[] for detailed information about creating and using devfiles.
+
* The Git repository __<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>__ is available over HTTPS and contains a `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` in the root folder. See xref:authoring-devfiles-version-2.adoc[].

how to start a {prod-short} workspace using a factory URL. The factory URL is a link pointing {prod-short} to a Git source repository containing a devfile. 
+
A {prod-short} workspace can be created by pointing to a devfile that is stored in a Git source repository on a feature branch of the userâ€™s choice. The {prod-short} instance then uses the discovered devfile to build a workspace.

//REWRITE, THE NEW RELEVANT LINK PROCEDURE IS TO BE LOCATED IN ADVANCED USE, AS IN NEXT COMMENT LINE:
* Your administrator maintains the `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` file in the root directory of the Git repository.
//NOTE: Advanced users can compose and use their own devfiles, as well as use a local devfile.
//provide links on "compose" and "local devfile" to the corresponding sections in Advanced Use (User Guide). Max
* The repository is available over HTTPS.
