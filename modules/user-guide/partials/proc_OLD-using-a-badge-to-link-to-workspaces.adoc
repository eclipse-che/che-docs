* Your {prod-short} administrator xref:ADMINISTRATION-GUIDE#proc_including-the-workspace-creating-badge-in-a-readme.adoc[included the workspace-greating badge in a README].

It is common for code repositories to display badges in their `README` files that describe various aspects of the project, such as its test coverage, latest build status, link to documentation, and other things. For example, the {prod-short} GitHub `README` has the following badges:

image::workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png[link="../_images/workspace_button/eclipse_che_badges.png"]

To make the process of using {prod-short} easier, the following badge is available: image:https://www.eclipse.org/che/contribute.svg[Factory Badge]

Use this badge and link it to a {prod-short} instance to quickly open a developer workspace.
