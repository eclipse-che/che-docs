//mention devfile
//BEFORE TELLING READERS ABOUT THE DEVFILE URL, WE NEED MENTION WHAT A DEVFILE IS AND WHAT IT DOES

//* a repo containing a devfile
//* a repo without a devile, and what happens in this case = universal image
//REWRITE FOR THIS TOPIC IF NECESSARY: As a user, you can create a workspace containing a clone of a Git repository by entering a custom URL in the address bar of your browser.

//THE STATUS UI ELEMENT OF EACH WORKSPACE UNDER BOTH *Workspaces* AND *RECENT WORKSPACES*
//describe the statuses and show screenshots of the icons:
// running
// stopped
// error
// any other state/status?
