= Creating a workspace from the default branch of a Git repository

This section describes how to start a {prod-short} workspace using a factory URL. The factory URL is a link pointing {prod-short} to a Git source repository containing a devfile. 

.Prerequisites

* The Git repository __<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>__ is available over HTTPS and contains a `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` in the root folder. See xref:authoring-devfiles-version-2.adoc[].

.Procedure

pass:[<!-- vale CheDocs.TechnicalTerms = NO -->]

// the unstated first and second steps appear to be one and the same

//vague sentence:
* Run the workspace by opening the factory URL:
+
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/#__<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>__]`
+
.Create a workspace on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat from the default branch of the `https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server` repository using the short factory URL format.
