//LOOKS LIKE THIS HAS TO BE A PAGE/ASSEMBY!

//TRY TO REUSE FOR BOTH 'PROJECTS WITH GIT' AND 'PROJECTS WITHOUT GIT':

MENTION THAT YOU MANAGE WORKSPACES IN THE DASHBOARD AND BY USING THE ESSENTIAL LINKS

////
REUSE BY XREF AS MANY OF THE FOLLOWING MODULES AS POSSIBLE IN BOTH 'PROJECTS WITH GIT' AND 'PROJECTS WITHOUT GIT'
  LOG IN AS A USER (SHOULD EXPLAIN WHEN/HOW THE LOGIN PAGE APPEARS)
//SEPARATE PROC DRAFTED: START A NEW WORKSPACE
  REOPEN BY REVISITING A COPIED/SAVED/BOOKMARKED LINK AFTER (FOR EXAMPLE, ACCIDENTALLY) CLOSING THE BROWSER TAB/WINDOW
////REUSE THIS ALSO IN THE PROC FOR STARTING A NEW WORKSPACE:
  ----
You can copy the link to a running workspace from the address bar of the browser, and/or you can bookmark the link in your browser. Here add the snip for bookmarking pages.

if you close the tab with the workspace by mistake, if your browser is still open, you can reopen the closed tab, and the workspace will reconnect.
If you log out from the dashboard and/or close your browser, or use a different browser, entering the workspace URL will result in having to log in and after that the running workspace will reconnect.
If the workspace is stopped, and you enter the workspace link, the workspace will start.
----
TIP: to go to the dashboard when you don't have the Che URL saved as a browser bookmark, just remove the workspace part of the URL (the Che URL will ?remain?), and press Enter go to the Che URL.
----
////
  STOP (from the dashboard)
  RESTART (from the dashboard; TIP: from the dashboard in verbose mode; from the workspace URL?)
    Restart only if the workspace appears to be stopped in the dashboard UI (which is which UI element and which of the UI element's states?)
  MODIFY? (DEVFILE?) DOES MODIFY BELONG TO ADVANCED USE? PROBABLY! MOVE IT THERE TO KEEP A PROC FILE FOR IT READY
  DELETE/REMOVE (from the dashboard)
NB: other terms used in the equivalent procs in the old docs: execute a (new) workspace, run a (new) workspace.

THE FOLLOWING IS RELEVANT TO (a) USING THE WORKSPACE, (b) STOP, (c) RESTART:

(timeout limits are covered in another section)
and users's limits
