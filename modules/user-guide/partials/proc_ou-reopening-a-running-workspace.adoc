= Reopening a running workspace

If the workspace is currently running, and you have not opened a browser tab for it or already closed the tab with it, you can reopen the workspace by visiting the URL of the workspace (as a browser bookmark).

//ADD A SENTENCE ABOUT THE STATUS UI ELEMENT OF EACH WORKSPACE UNDER *RECENT WORKSPACES*
//MENTION REOPENING BY REOPENING THE CLOSED TAB THROUGH THE BROWSER MENU
//MENTION HAVING TO LOG IN, IF NECESSARY.
//RECOMMEND THE USEFULNESS OF THE DASHBOARD FOR WORKSPACE MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH/STATUS MONITORING?
//Visiting this URL in a new browser tab when the workspace is running opens the workspace in the tab.
//You can visit this URL to access the workspace when it is running.

[TIP]
====
If you do not have the URL of the running workspace saved as a browser bookmark, you can open the running workspace by using the {prod-short} dashboard:
. Go to *Workspaces*.
. Locate the workspace in the list.
. Click *Open*. This opens a new tab with the workspace.
