//= Creating a workspace from a publicly accessible standalone devfile using HTTP

//it is not clear yet or under which conditions: if entering the same url again later opens or restarts the same workspace

Projects that do not use Git use a hosted devfile that is available over HTTPS for configuring new workspaces. As a user, you can start a new workspace by entering a custom URL to the hosted devfile in the address bar of your browser.

NOTE: Advanced users can write and use their own devfiles, as well as use a local devfile.
//provide links on "write" and "local devfile" to the corresponding sections in Advanced Use (User Guide). Max

.Prerequisites

* Your administrator maintains a remotely hosted `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml`.
* The devfile is currently available over HTTPS.

.Procedure

//i'm adding a separate concept module about logging in to {prod-short}

//this sentence looks like it belongs in the intro par. consider moving it there and provide a more verification-focused procedure step:
Then {prod-short} starts a workspace and clones the repository `https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server`.

MERGE:
