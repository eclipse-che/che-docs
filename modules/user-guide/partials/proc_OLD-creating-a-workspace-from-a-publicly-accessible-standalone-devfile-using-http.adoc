= Creating a workspace from a publicly accessible standalone devfile using HTTP

A workspace can be created using a devfile, the URL of which is pointing to the raw content of the devfile. The {prod-short} instance then uses the discovered devfile to build a workspace.

.Prerequisites
* The publicly-accessible standalone `devfile.yaml` file. See xref:authoring-devfiles-version-2.adoc[] for detailed information about creating and using devfiles.

.Procedure
. Execute the workspace by opening the following URL: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/#https://__<yourhosturl>__/devfile.yaml]`
