= Creating a workspace from the default branch of a Git repository

//currently duplicated line:
This section describes how to start a {prod-short} workspace using a factory URL. The factory URL is a link pointing {prod-short} to a Git source repository containing a devfile. 

//rewrite by stating that in addition to the short format, there is also the long format:

The factory URL exist in two forms:

* the short form `/#$URL`
* long `/f?url=$URL` form that supports additional configuration parameters used in previous versions of {prod-short}

.Prerequisites

* The Git repository __<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>__ is available over HTTPS and contains a `devfile.yaml` or `.devfile.yaml` in the root folder. See xref:authoring-devfiles-version-2.adoc[].

.Procedure

// the unstated first and second steps appear to be one and the same. max

//rewrite by stating that in addition to the short format, there is also the long format:

//try to integrate the following few lines into the above intro and then remove these lines from below:
//vague sentence:
* Run the workspace by opening the factory URL. Two formats are available:
+
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/#__<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>__]`:: This is the short format.
`pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/f?url=__<GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>__]`:: This long format supports additional configuration parameters.

.Create a workspace on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat from the default branch of the `https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-server` repository using the long factory URL format.
