In some cases, you may need to restart your workspace while it is still running.

To start a stopped workspace or restart a running workspace by using the dashboard:
*Progress* tab
Clicking on the workspace name (re)starts the workspace and opens a new browser tab with a page that shows the page tab with the overview points of the progress of starting the workspace.

.Procedure

A
If the workspace is stopped, and you visit the workspace link (as a browser bookmark), the workspace will start.

B
. Go to the {prod-short} dashboard.
. Locate the workspace under *RECENT WORKSPACES*.
. Hover on the workspace name.
. Go to *â‹®* *>* *Restart Workspace*.
//THE ALTERNATIVE IS IN THE WORKSPACES PAGE - I PREFER IT DUE TO STANDARDIZATION OF ALL ACTIONS AND ALL PROCEDURES. BESIDES, THE USER HAS THE WHOLE TAB OPEN, IT'S MORE USABEL AS WORKSPACES THAN RECENT WORKSPACES.

C
TIP: To open a new tab with the restarting workspace:
. Go to the {prod-short} dashboard.
