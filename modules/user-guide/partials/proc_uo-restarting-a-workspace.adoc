= Restarting a workspace

You may stop your running workspace manually, or it may stop automatically due to reaching an idle timeout limit or a running timeout limit (as set by the administrator of your {prod-short} instance). In some cases, you may need to restart your workspace while it is still running.

To start a stopped workspace or restart a running workspace by using the dashboard:
*Progress* tab
Clicking on the workspace name (re)starts the workspace and opens a new browser tab with a page that shows the page tab with the overview points of the progress of starting the workspace.
