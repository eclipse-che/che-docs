EXPLAIN WHERE AND HOW USERS SHOULD EXPECT TO LOG IN (FACE THE LOGIN PAGE)

. In the login page, authenticate yourself as a {prod-short} user with your username and password, according to the information provided by your {prod-short} administrator.
//here must not say "{prod-short} username and password" or "{prod-short} credentials
//although i'm adding a separate concept module about logging in to {prod-short}, this procedure may require it as a step, in which case i should just xref to the separate module about logging in (for more info); in any case, the logging in happens after the step of entering the URL in the browser's address bar, and then probably before seeing the progress UI; however, THIS MUST BE TESTED WITH THE USER ALREADY LOGGED IN AND HAVING A DASHBOARD OPEN, BUT CHECK IF AUTHENTICATION IS REPOSITORY-SPECIFIC.

. Enter your username and password in the login page to be redirected to the {prod-short} dashboard. If you are already logged in, the {prod-short} dashboard is loaded without requesting your credentials.
//REMAINDER: the first sentence may be entirely redundant and totally confusing (a user who already has a dashboard open would open one more tab with the dashboard, which doesn't make sense) if the second sentence applies.
//REMAINDER: {prod-url} this is the URL that is also mentioned in the next step for a different purpose, so it'd be useful to introduce it here or overall for this procedure
