1. "Che host URL"

the URL of your organization's {prod-short} instance

Your administrator must provide you with "Che host URL" which you need to access the {prod-short} dashboard and start and manage your workspaces. Save this 
for example in your browser favorites toolbar or another location which you keep open daily, so that you can simply click on the previously saved link, as opposed to having to put this link together from the "Che host URL" and the repository URL. Keep it somewhere handy.

2. New workspace starting URLs
//THIS IS USEFUL **ONLY** FOR STARTING A NEW WORKSPACE, BUT THE USER SHOULD FULLY EXPLORE THE OPTIONS OF STOPPING AND RESTARTING AN ALREADY CREATED WORKSPACE

//BEFORE TELLING READERS ABOUT THE DEVFILE URL, WE NEED MENTION WHAT A DEVFILE IS AND WHAT IT DOES

//REWRITE THIS PAR, NEEDS MORE WORK:
When you have the Che host URL from your administrator, then for every remote Git repository that you have to work with inside workspaces, you can prepare and save, for example in your browser favorites toolbar or another location which you keep open daily, so that you can simply click on the previously saved link, as opposed to having to put this link together from the "Che host URL" and the repository URL. Keep it somewhere handy.
//HERE WE GET INTO ISSUES WITH NEW WORKSPACE NAMING/STARTING POLICY
//However, the following is applicable only to Projects with Git: TIP: For git repositories with webpages (like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket?), entering this URL is simple: Copy the Che/CRW URL, open the git repository page in your internet browser, paste your copied Che/CRW URL in the address bar in front of the URL of the git repository page, and type # in between your Che/CRW and the git repository page. Press Enter.

Alternative procedure that can be mentioned:
In the {prod-short} Dashboard:
.(check the running UI which tab to describe here)
. Enter the url of the remote publicly accessible standalone devfile in the *URL of devfile* field and click *Load devfile*.

= Creating a workspace from a publicly accessible standalone devfile using HTTP

A workspace can be created using a devfile, the URL of which is pointing to the raw content of the devfile. The {prod-short} instance then uses the discovered devfile to build a workspace.

.Prerequisites
* The publicly-accessible standalone `devfile.yaml` file. See xref:authoring-devfiles-version-2.adoc[] for detailed information about creating and using devfiles.

.Procedure
. Execute the workspace by opening the following URL: `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/#https://__<yourhosturl>__/devfile.yaml]`

ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
