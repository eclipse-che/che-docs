= Registering to Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat

This section describes how to register to Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat.

.Procedure

. Navigate to link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift].

. Register with an existing OpenShift Online, Red Hat Developer Program, or Red Hat Customer Portal account, *or* create a new Red Hat account.

. Verify the telephone number

IMPORTANT: A valid telephone number is required for reducing the creation of fraudulent accounts on the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift. Red Hat will not use this information for any other reason, and you will never receive a telephone call from Red Hat or any third-party because of trying the sandbox.

. Once the account is provisioned, Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat will be ready for use from both link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/ide[Developer Sandbox] and https://workspaces.openshift.com pages.
