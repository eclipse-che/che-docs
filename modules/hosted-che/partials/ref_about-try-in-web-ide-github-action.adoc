The link:https://github.com/marketplace/actions/try-in-web-ide[Try in Web IDE GitHub action] can be added to a GitHub repository workflow to help reviewers quickly test pull requests on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat.
The action achieves this by listening to pull request events and providing a factory URL by creating a comment, a status check, or both.
This factory URL creates a new workspace from the pull request branch on Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat.

NOTE: The Che documentation repository (https://github.com/eclipse/che-docs) is a real-life example where the Try in Web IDE GitHub action helps reviewers quickly test pull requests. Experience the workflow by navigating to a recent pull request and opening a factory URL.
