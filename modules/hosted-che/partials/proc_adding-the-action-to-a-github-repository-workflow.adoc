= Adding the action to a GitHub repository workflow

This section describes how to integrate the Try in Web IDE GitHub action to a GitHub repository workflow.

.Prerequisites

* A GitHub repository
* A devfile in the root of the GitHub repository.

.Procedure

. In the GitHub repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory if it does not exist already.

. Create an `example.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory with the following content:
+
include::example$snip_github-action-yaml-example.adoc[]
This code snippet creates a workflow named `Try in Web IDE example`, with a job that runs the `v1` version of the `redhat-actions/try-in-web-ide` community action.
The workflow is triggered on the link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows[`pull_request_target` event],
 on the `opened` activity type.

. Optionally configure the activity types from the `on.pull_request_target.types` field to customize when workflow trigger. Activity types such as `reopened` and `synchronize` can be useful.

. Optionally configure the `add_comment` and `add_status` GitHub action inputs within `example.yml`. These inputs are sent to the Try in Web IDE GitHub action to customize whether comments and status checks are to be made.
