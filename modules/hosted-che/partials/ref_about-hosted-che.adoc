= About Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat

Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat is an open source product based on link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse {prod-short}] that is running on link:https://www.openshift.com/products/dedicated/[OpenShift Dedicated].
The new service is part of the link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift] offering, and is using link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[{rh-os-devspaces}], which is built upon Eclipse Che and is optimized for Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Linux.

== Differences between Eclipse Che and {rh-os-devspaces}

{rh-os-devspaces} is the product that is built from the Eclipse Che project. The product is normally two versions behind the project. Red Hat also provides licensing, packaging, and support, so {rh-os-devspaces} is considered a more stable product than the upstream Eclipse Che project. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_dev_spaces/3.0/html-single/release_notes_and_known_issues/index#about-devspaces_devspaces[About {rh-os-devspaces}].

NOTE: link:https://workspaces.openshift.com/[Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat] provides both {rh-os-devspaces} product-specific, as well as Eclipse Che community devfiles on the "Get Started" tab of the User Dashboard.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Eclipse Che and {rh-os-devspaces} share all the features - all the product's functionality is available in the project and vice versa. However, not all the upstream plug-ins are available in the {rh-os-devspaces}. To use an unsupported plug-in inside the {rh-os-devspaces}, one must explicitly point to the raw `meta.yaml` of the plug-in from the devfile.
