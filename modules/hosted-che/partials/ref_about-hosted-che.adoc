== Differences between Eclipse Che and Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

Red Hat Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is the product that is built from the Eclipse Che project. The product is normally two versions behind the project. Red Hat also provides licensing, packaging, and support, so Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is considered a more stable product than the upstream Eclipse Che project. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_devspaces/2.14/html/release_notes_and_known_issues/about-devspaces_crw[About Red Hat Dev Spaces].

NOTE: link:https://workspaces.openshift.com/[Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat] provides both Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces product-specific, as well as, Eclipse Che community devfiles on the "Get Started" tab of the User Dashboard.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Eclipse Che and Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces share all the features - all the product's functionality is available in the project and vice versa. However, not all the upstream plug-ins are available in the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces. To use an unsupported plug-in inside the Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces, one must explicitly point to the raw `meta.yaml` of the plug-in from the devfile.
