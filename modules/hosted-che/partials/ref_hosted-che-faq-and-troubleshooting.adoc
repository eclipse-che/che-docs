== Troubleshooting

.Authentication

To authenticate to link:https://workspaces.openshift.com[Red Hat Developer Sandbox], allow cookies from the `static.developers.redhat.com` page. 
WARNING: The authentication may fail if the the cookies are blocked by the browser extensions that interfere with cookie handling, such as ad-blockers or privacy-focused extensions.

.Telemetry

Telemetry is enabled in Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat, so Woopra or Segment tracking scripts must be explicitly allowed in case being blocked by a browser extension:

- \https://api.segment.io/v1/t 
- \https://static.woopra.com/js/w.js

In case, the browser is running in the incognito mode the third-party cookies must be explicitly unblocked:

Otherwise, the workspace startup will fail.
