= Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and Troubleshooting

== FAQs

Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat is part of the link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift] offering. 
The common FAQs are available on the link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox#assembly-field-sections-57861[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift] website. 

== Troubleshooting

.Authentication

To authenticate to https://workspaces.openshift.com, one needs to allow cookies from the `static.developers.redhat.com`.
In case these cookies are blocked (by a browser extension like https://www.eff.org/privacybadger[Privacy Badger]),
authentication will fail.

.Telemetry

Telemetry is enabled in Eclipse Che hosted by Red Hat, so Woopra / Segment tracking scripts must be explicitly allowed in case being blocked by a browser extension:

- https://api.segment.io/v1/t 
- https://static.woopra.com/js/w.js

In case, the browser is running in the incognito mode the third-party cookies must be explicitly unblocked:

Otherwise, the workspace startup will fail.
