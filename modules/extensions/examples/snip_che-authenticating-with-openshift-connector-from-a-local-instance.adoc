When using a local instance of OpenShift such as CodeReady Containers, {prod-short} stores the userâ€™s credentials in a `~/.kube/config` file in the workspace. Use this file for automatic authentication in subsequent logins. In the context of {prod-short}, the `~/.kube/config` is stored as a part of the plug-in sidecar container.
