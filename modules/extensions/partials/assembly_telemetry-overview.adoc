:context: telemetry-overview

Telemetry is the explicit and ethical collection of operation data. By default, telemetry is not available in {prod}, but there is an abstract API that allows enabling telemetry using the plug-in mechanism. This approach is used in the xref:overview:hosted-che.adoc[] service where telemetry is enabled for every workspace.

This documentation includes a guide describing how to make your own telemetry client for {prod}, followed by an overview of the link:https://github.com/che-incubator/che-workspace-telemetry-woopra-plugin[{prod} Woopra Telemetry Plugin].

== Use cases
[id="use-cases_{context}"]

{prod} telemetry API allows tracking:

* Duration of a workspace utilization
* User-driven actions such as file editing, committing, and pushing to remote repositories.
* The list of plug-ins enabled in a workspace
* Programming languages and devfiles used in workspaces. See xref:end-user-guide:authoring-devfiles-version-2.adoc[]

== How it works
[id="how-it-works_{context}"]

When a {prod-short} workspace starts, the `che-theia` container starts the telemetry plug-in, which is responsible for sending telemetry events to a back-end. If the `$CHE_WORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT` environment variable was set in the workspace Pod, the telemetry plug-in will send events to a back-end listening at that port.

If the {prod-short} workspace has a telemetry back-end container running, and it is listening on `$CHE_WORKSPACE_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_PORT`, it takes the events sent from the telemetry plug-in, turns them into the back-end-specific representation of events, and sends them to the configured analytics back-end (for example, Segment or Woopra).
