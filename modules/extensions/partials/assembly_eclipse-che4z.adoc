= Eclipse Che4z

Eclipse Che4z is an all-in-one mainframe extension stack for {prod}, which provides a modern experience for mainframe software developers working with z/OS applications.

Powered by the open-source projects link:https://www.zowe.org/[Zowe] and link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs[Eclipse Che], Che4z offers an easy and streamlined on-boarding process to get new developers using the tools they need. Using container technology and stacks, {prod} brings the necessary technology to the task at hand.

Developers can find the code they need to work on in Explorer for Endevor, Git and Zowe Explorer, edit code assisted by COBOL or HLASM Language Support, and test the resulting code with the Debugger, all in one Mainframe development package.

Eclipse Che4z is an open source project. Many of the components of the Che4z stack are also available on the VS Code marketplace as part of the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=broadcomMFD.code4z-extension-pack[Code4z] package.

== Use cases

The Eclipse Che4z extension allows:

* Viewing and editing CA Endevor SCM data in the {prod} environment.
* Editing COBOL and High Level Assembler language files with syntax awareness and autocomplete features.
* Browsing mainframe data sets in the {prod} environment.
* Debugging CICS and Batch programs written in COBOL.
* Performing tasks on mainframe applications using a command-line interface.

== Getting Started

For instructions on how to install the Eclipse Che4z stack, see the https://github.com/eclipse/che-che4z[Che4z Git repository]

== Components

The Eclipse Che4z extension includes the following components:

=== COBOL Language Support

COBOL Language Support enhances the COBOL programming experience on your IDE. The extension leverages the language server protocol to provide autocomplete, syntax coloring, highlighting and diagnostic features for COBOL code and copybooks. The COBOL Language Support extension can also connect to a mainframe using a Zowe CLI z/OSMF profile to automatically retrieve copybooks used in your programs and store them in your workspace.

== Sample Workflows

=== COBOL Language Support using CA Endevor Bridge for Git and Explorer for Endevor

* Use VS Code’s built-in Git interface to clone source code from CA Endevor using Endevor’s Bridge for Git.
* Edit COBOL code using COBOL Language Support, taking advantage of all the coding assistance provided by the extension.
* Locate all copybooks in the Git folder structure, and if needed, download other copybooks used in the source code from the mainframe.
* Use VS Code’s built-in Git interface to push, pull and merge changes.
* Search and browse additional code elements in the entire map of Endevor using the Explorer for Endevor extension. The COBOL Language Support extension provides syntax awareness for COBOL elements.
* Download code elements, including their dependencies, into the current workspace using the Explorer for Endevor extension, and synchronize them with the Git project if code modifications are needed.

=== Debugger for Mainframe

* Provide InterTest server location, CICS region, credentials and program or transaction name (either by file or input form).
* Obtain the listing and set breakpoints.
* Trigger the CICS transaction and start a debug session.
* Display and change variable values.
* Stop at designated breakpoints, continue from a designated breakpoint and step through the listing.
* Close the debug session.

=== Zowe Explorer and Zowe CLI

* Access mainframe files and execute jobs, either from an interactive graphical interface or in the terminal with CLI. Whether you need to view a PDS, allocate a dataset, change a JCL, submit a mainframe compile, or download and upload files, Zowe Explorer and Zowe CLI interfaces provide these capabilities.
