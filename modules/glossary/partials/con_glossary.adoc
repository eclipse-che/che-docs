This section provides an overview of the main terms and expressions used throughout {prod} documentation.

== Naming
{prod}:: A developer platform for the cloud that provides an in-browser IDE. {prod-short} tools can be extended by adding development services, such as language servers, debug adapters, or editors (IDEs) packaged as containers. 

Che-Theia:: The default editor component of a {prod-short} workspace. It is a {prod-short}-specific customization of the Eclipse Theia editor. Che-Theia can be extended using Che-Theia plug-ins, which are packaged as containers for ease of deployment and use. Che-Theia plug-ins are usually compatible with Visual Studio extensions.

{prod-short} Workspace:: A container-based development environment managed by {prod}. Every {prod-short} workspace is defined by a devfile. A {prod-short} workspace is composed of an editor, runtime and build containers and other development tools running inside containers.

== Terminology

`Editor`:: A web application that is used as an editor in a workspace.

`Plugin`:: Plug-ins are services that extend {prod-short} workspace capabilities. {prod-short} plug-ins are packaged as containers. plug-ins are extensions of an editor or a service running in the container. For example, the Che-Theia editor is compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions. 
//TODO See for a diagram of {prod-short} extensibility architecture. 
Both {prod-short} plug-ins and editors are distributed through the {prod-short} plug-ins registry. 
 
Workspace:: A container-based development environment managed by {prod}. Every  {prod-short} workspace is defined by a devfile. A  {prod-short} workspace can be composed by an editor, some plug-ins and runtime containers. Workspace runtime containers can be defined as simple container images or as {platforms-name} resources. A {prod-short} Workspace can be associated with source code projects hosted on a remote CVS server. A {prod-short} Workspace can contain the definition of one or more commands such as `run`, `build`, or `debug`.

Devfile:: A workspace configuration template. Devfiles are used to create workspaces in the Dashboard. A devfile includes metadata such as scope, tags, components, description, name, and identification. Visual Studio Code API is one of the plug-in APIs that can be used in Theia.

Factory:: A template that contains the configuration to automate the generation of a new workspace using a factory identifier or a devfile added to the URL of the IDE. Use factories to create replicas of existing workspaces or to automate the provisioning of statically or dynamically defined workspaces.

Project:: A source code repository.
