= Setting up the {identity-provider} {prod-id-short}-username-readonly theme for the {prod} login page

The following procedure is relevant for all {prod-short} instances with the OpenShift OAuth service enabled.

When a user with pre-created namespaces logs in to {prod} Dashboard for the first time, a page allowing the user to update account information is displayed. It is possible to change the username, but choosing a username that doesn't match the OpenShift username, prevents the user's workspaces from running. This is caused by {prod-short} attempts to use a non-existing namespace, the name of which is derived from a user OpenShift username, to create a workspace. To prevent this, log in to {identity-provider} and modify the theme settings.
