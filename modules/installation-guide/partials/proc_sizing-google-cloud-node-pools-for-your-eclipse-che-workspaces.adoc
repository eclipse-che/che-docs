= Sizing Google Cloud node pools for your Eclipse Che workspaces

The default node pool is using machine types `n1-standard-1`. You may need to use different kind of machine to run your workspaces. See link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types?hl=en#n1_standard_machine_types[]

Changing the machine type configuration of an existing node pool is not possible with Google Cloud Platform.

One solution is to create a new node pool and delete the existing one afterwards. Google Kubernetes Engine would then transfer the workloads to the new node pool automatically.

Another solution is to have two node pools with one dedicated to the workspaces by configuring {prod} with a NodeSelector. See xref:configuring-workspaces-nodeselector.adoc[].

Preferably choose machine types according the workspaces CPU and memory requirements.
