= Sizing Google Cloud node pools for your {prod-short} workspaces

The default node pool is using machine types `n1-standard-1`. You may need to use different kind of machine to run your workspaces. See link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types?hl=en#n1_standard_machine_types[]

With Google Cloud Platform, you cannot change the machine type configuration of an existing node pool.

One solution is to create a new node pool and delete the existing one afterwards. Google {kubernetes} Engine would then transfer the workloads to the new node pool automatically.

Another solution is to have two node pools with one dedicated to the workspaces by configuring {prod} with a NodeSelector. See xref:configuring-workspaces-nodeselector.adoc[].

Preferably choose machine types according the workspaces CPU and memory requirements.
