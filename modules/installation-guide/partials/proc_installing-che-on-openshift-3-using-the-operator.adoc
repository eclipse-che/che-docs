= Installing {prod-short} on OpenShift 3 using the Operator

This section describes how to install {prod-short} on OpenShift 3 with the `{prod-cli}` CLI management tool. The method of installation is using the Operator and enable TLS (HTTPS).

Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a {platforms-name} application which also provide the following:

* Repeatability of installation and upgrade.
* Constant health checks of every system component.
* Over-the-air (OTA) updates for OpenShift components and independent software vendor (ISV) content.
* A place to encapsulate knowledge from field engineers and spread it to all users.

[NOTE]
====
This approach is only supported for use with {ocp} and {osd} version 3.11, but also work for newer versions of {ocp} and {osd}, and serves as a backup installation method for situations when the installation method using OperatorHub is not available.
====

.Prerequisites

* Administrator rights on a running instance of OpenShift 3.11.

* An installation of the `oc` OpenShift 3.11 CLI management tool. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli[Installing the OpenShift 3.11 CLI].

* An installation of the `{prod-cli}` management tool. See xref:using-the-chectl-management-tool.adoc[].

* To apply settings that the main {prod-cli} command-line parameters cannot set, prepare a configuration file `operator-cr-patch.yaml` that will override the default values in the `CheCluster` Custom Resource used by the Operator. See xref:configuring-the-che-installation.adoc[].

* Use the {prod-namespace} namespace as the default installation project.

* Configure OpenShift to pull images from `registry.redhat.com`. See link:https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication[Red Hat Container Registry Authentication].

.Procedure

. Log in to OpenShift. See link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#basic-setup-and-login[Basic Setup and Login].
