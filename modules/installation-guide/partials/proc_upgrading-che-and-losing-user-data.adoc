[id="upgrading-{prod-id-short}-and-losing-user-data_{context}"]

= Upgrading {prod-short} and losing user data

When {prod-short} is upgraded and user data is not backed up, workspace configuration and user preferences are going to be preserved but all runtime data will be wiped out.

.Procedure 

 . Notify all {prod-short} users about the upcoming data wipe. 
 . Change {orch-namespace} strategy to `per user`.

NOTE: Upgrading without backing up user data has disadvantage. Original PVs with runtime data are going to be preserved and will no longer be used. This may lead to the waste of resources.
