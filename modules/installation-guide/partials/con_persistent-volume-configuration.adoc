= Storage strategies for {prod-id-short} workspaces

Workspace Pods use Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), which are bound to the physical Persistent Volumes (PVs) with link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes[ReadWriteOnce access mode]. It is possible to configure how the {prod-short} server uses PVCs for workspaces. The individual methods for this configuration are called PVC strategies:


[width="100%",cols="^,^,^,^",options="header"]
|===
|Strategy |Details |Pros |Cons
|*common (default)* |
One PVC is shared across all workspaces of a given user


| Easy to manage and control storage | If PV does not support `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode, the configuration will work only if one or both of the following apply:

* Each workspace is in a separate {platforms-namespace}

* Only one workspace is running per {platforms-namespace} at the same time. See xref:installation-guide:configuring-the-number-of-workspaces-that-a-user-can-run.adoc[].
|*per-workspace* |

One PVC for one workspace

| Easier to manage and control storage compared to unique strategy  | PV count is not known and depends on the number of workspaces
|*unique* |

One PVC per workspace volume or user-defined PVC

| Storage isolation | An undefined number of PVs are required
|===

{prod-short} uses the `common` PVC strategy in combination with the "one {orch-namespace} per user" {orch-namespace} strategy when all {prod-short} workspaces operate in the user's {orch-namespace}, sharing one PVC.

[id="the-common-pvc-strategy_{context}"]
== The `common` PVC strategy

All workspaces inside a {platforms-namespace} use the same Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) as the default data storage when storing data such as the following in their declared volumes:

* projects
* workspace logs
* additional Volumes defined by a use

When the `common` PVC strategy is in use, user-defined PVCs are ignored, and volumes related to these user-defined PVCs are replaced with a volume that refers to the common PVC.
In this strategy, all {prod-short} workspaces use the same PVC. When the user runs one workspace, it only binds to one node in the cluster at a time.

The corresponding containers volume mounts link to a common volume, and sub-paths are prefixed with `_<workspace-ID>_` or `__<original-PVC-name>__`. For more details, see xref:how-subpaths-are-used-in-pvcs_{context}[].

The {prod-short} Volume name is identical to the name of the user-defined PVC. It means that if a machine is configured to use a {prod-short} volume with the same name as the user-defined
PVC has, they will use the same shared folder in the common PVC.

When a workspace is deleted, a corresponding subdirectory (`$\{ws-id}`) is deleted in the PV directory.

NOTE: The common PVC will be removed when a user's workspaces are all deleted. The PVC will be re-created when a non-ephemeral workspace is started.

.Restrictions on using the `common` PVC strategy

When the `common` strategy is used, and a workspace PVC access mode is ReadWriteOnce (RWO), only one node can simultaneously use the PVC.

If there are several nodes, you can use the `common` strategy, but:

* The workspace PVC access mode must be reconfigured to `ReadWriteMany` (RWM), so multiple nodes can use this PVC simultaneously.

* Only one workspace in the same {orch-namespace} may be running. See xref:installation-guide:configuring-the-number-of-workspaces-that-a-user-can-run.adoc[].

The `common` PVC strategy is not suitable for large multi-node clusters. Therefore, it is best to use it in single-node clusters. However, in combination with the `per-workspace` {orch-namespace} strategy, the `common` PVC strategy is usable for clusters with not more than 75 nodes. The PVC used with this strategy must be large enough to accommodate all projects to prevent a situation in which one project depletes the resources of others.

[id="the-per-workspace-pvc-strategy_{context}"]
== The `per-workspace` PVC strategy

The `per-workspace` strategy is similar to the `common` PVC strategy. The only difference is that all workspace Volumes, but not all the workspaces, use the same PVC as the default data storage for:

* projects
* workspace logs
* additional Volumes defined by a user

With this strategy, {prod-short} keeps its workspace data in assigned PVs that are allocated by a single PVC.

The `per-workspace` PVC strategy is the universal strategy out of the PVC strategies available and acts as a proper option for large multi-node clusters with a higher amount of users. Using the `per-workspace` PVC strategy, users can run multiple workspaces simultaneously, which results in more PVCs being created.

[id="the-unique-pvc-strategy_{context}"]
== The `unique` PVC strategy

Using the `unique `PVC strategy, every {prod-short} Volume of a workspace has its own PVC. The workspace PVCs are then:

* Created when a workspace starts for the first time.
* Deleted when a corresponding workspace is deleted.

User-defined PVCs are created with the following specifics:

* They are provisioned with generated names to prevent naming conflicts with other PVCs in a {orch-namespace}.

* Subpaths of the mounted Physical persistent volumes that reference user-defined PVCs are prefixed with `_<workspace-ID>_` or `__<PVC-name>__`. This ensures that the same PV data structure is configured with different PVC strategies. For details, see xref:how-subpaths-are-used-in-pvcs_{context}[].

The `unique` PVC strategy is suitable for larger multi-node clusters with a lesser amount of users. Since this strategy operates with separate PVCs for each volume in a workspace, vastly more PVCs are created.


[id="how-subpaths-are-used-in-pvcs_{context}"]
== How subpaths are used in PVCs

Subpaths illustrate the folder hierarchy in the Persistent Volumes (PV).

----
/pv0001
  /workspaceID1
  /workspaceID2
  /workspaceIDn
    /che-logs
    /projects
    /<volume1>
    /<volume2>
    /<User-defined PVC name 1 | volume 3>
    ...
----

When a user defines volumes for components in the devfile, all components that define the volume of the same name will be backed by the same directory in the PV as `__<PV-name>__`, `__<workspace-ID>__, or `__<original-PVC-name>__`. Each component can have this location mounted on a different path in its containers.


.Example
Using the `common` PVC strategy, user-defined PVCs are replaced with subpaths on the common PVC. When the user references a volume as `my-volume`, it is mounted in the common-pvc with the `/workspace-id/my-volume` subpath.
