= Storage strategies for {prod-id-short} workspaces

Storage strategy::
A configurable method defining how {prod-short} workspaces uses persistent volume claims (PVCs) and persistent volumes (PVs). 
It defines the storage for workspace data: projects, workspace logs, or additional Volumes defined by a user.

|===

Persistent volumes (PVs) access mode::
The nature of the persistent volume determines the available access mode: `ReadWriteMany` or `ReadWriteOnce`.
See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes[Kubernetes documentation - access mode].
For example, link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html[Amazon EBS] supports only the `ReadWriteOnce` access mode.


[id="the-common-storage-strategy_{context}"]
== The `common` storage strategy

This is the default storage strategy.
For each user, all workspaces use the same Persistent Volume (PV) for the default data storage.

When the user starts a first non-ephemeral workspace, the workspace engine creates the common persistent volume.

When the user starts a non-ephemeral workspace, the workspace engine uses the common persistent volume.
The workspace only binds simultaneously to one node in the {orch-name} cluster.
The workspace engine ignores user-defined volumes. 
The workspace engine replaces volumes related to user-defined volumes with a subpath in the common volume. 
Subpaths have a `_<workspace-ID>_` or `__<original-volume-name>__` prefix.
See xref:how-subpaths-are-used-in-persistent-volumes_{context}[].
The {prod-short} Volume name is identical to the name of the user-defined persistent volume.
Therefore, if a workspace container uses a {prod-short} volume with the same name as the user-defined persistent volume, they will use the same shared folder in the common persistent volume.

When the user deletes a workspace, the workspace engine deletes the corresponding subdirectory (`$\{ws-id}`) in the persistent volume directory.

When the user deletes the last workspace, the workspace engine removes the common persistent volume. 

Restrictions on the `common` storage strategy with `ReadWriteOnce` access mode::
The `ReadWriteOnce` access mode limits each user to run one unique concurrent workspace.
See xref:installation-guide:configuring-the-number-of-workspaces-that-a-user-can-run.adoc[].

Scalability::
The `common` storage strategy is not suitable for multinode clusters with 'ReadWriteOnce' access mode for persistent volumes if the number of concurrently running workspaces per user is more than 1

Persistent volumes (PV) provisioning::
Create large enough persistent volume to accommodate all projects to prevent a situation in which one project depletes the resources of others.

[id="the-per-workspace-storage-strategy_{context}"]
== The `per-workspace` storage strategy

Each workspace uses one dedicated persistent volume. 
All {prod-short} Volumes defined in one workspace use the same persistent volume.

Scalability::
Consider enabling this strategy on large multinode clusters with a higher amount of users.

Persistent volumes (PV) provisioning::
Users can run multiple workspaces simultaneously. It results in more persistent volumes.

[id="the-unique-storage-strategy_{context}"]
== The `unique` storage strategy

Each {prod-short} Volume defined in a workspace has its own persistent volume.

When the user starts a workspace, the workspace engine creates the workspace persistent volumes.

The workspace engine generates an unique name for each persistent volume to prevent naming conflicts with other persistent volumes in the same {orch-namespace}.

To ensure that different storage strategies use the same persistent volume data structure, subpaths of the mounted persistent volumes that reference user-defined persistent volumes are prefixed with `_<workspace-ID>_` or `__<persistent-volume-name>__`. 
See xref:how-subpaths-are-used-in-persistent-volumes_{context}[].

When the user deletes a workspace, the workspace engine deletes all workspace persistent volumes.

Persistent volumes (PV) provisioning::
This is the strategy creating the highest volumes count.


[id="how-subpaths-are-used-in-persistent-volumes_{context}"]
== How subpaths are used in persistent volumes

Subpaths illustrate the folder hierarchy in the Persistent Volumes (PV).

/__<pv0001>__
  /__<workspaceID1>__
  /__<workspaceID2>__
  /__<workspaceIDn>__
    /che-logs
    /projects
    /__<volume1>__
    /__<volume2>__
    /__<user-defined-volume-name-1>__
    /__<user-defined-volume-name-2>__
    /__<user-defined-volume-name-3|volume3>__
    ...
----

When a user defines volumes for components in the devfile, all components that define the volume of the same name will be backed by the same directory in the persistent volume as `__<persistent-volume-name>__`, `__<workspace-ID>__`, or `__<original-volume-name>__`.
Each component can have this location mounted on a different path in its containers.

.Example
With the `common` storage strategy, the workspace engine replaces user-defined volumes with subpaths on the common persistent volume.
When the user references the `__<my-volume>__` volume, the workspace engine mounts it on the common persistent volume with the `/__<workspace-id>__/__<my-volume>__` subpath.
