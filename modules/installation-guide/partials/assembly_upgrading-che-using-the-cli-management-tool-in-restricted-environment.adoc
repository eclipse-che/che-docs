:context: upgrading-prod-short-using-the-cli-management-tool-in-restricted-environment

This section describes how to upgrade {prod} using the CLI management tool in restricted environment. The upgrade path supports minor version update, from {prod-short} version {prod-prev-ver} to version {prod-ver}.

.Prerequisites

* An administrative account on an instance of {platforms-name}.

* A running instance version {prod-prev-ver} of {prod}, installed using the CLI management tool on the same instance of {platforms-name}, with the {prod-cli} `--installer operator` method, in the `_<{prod-namespace}>_` project. See xref:installing-che-in-a-restricted-environment.adoc[].

* The `{prod-cli}` {prod-ver} management tool is available. See xref:overview:using-the-chectl-management-tool.adoc[].
