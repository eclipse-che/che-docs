= Configuring communication between {prod-short} components

To communicate together, {prod-short} components use the internal services names, which are exposed in the internal {platforms-name} network.

The administration can disable the use of the internal services names to force {prod-short} components to use external {platforms-ingress}. Using the external {platforms-ingress} might slow the traffic and lead to issues because it uses proxies, certificates, and firewalls.

Using the external {platforms-ingress} is necessary in the following situations:

* To deploy {prod-short} across multiple {platforms-name} clusters. The internal services names are not shared between distinct clusters.
* To deploy {prod-short} across multiple namespaces. The {orch-name} NetworkPolicies restricts communication between namespaces.
* To deploy {prod-short} with the multitenant network plugin.

.Prerequisites

* An instance of {prod-short} running on {platforms-name}.
* You have installed {prod-short} by using the Operator.

.Procedure

* Configure the `__<property-value>__` value of the `disableInternalClusterSVCNames` property in the CheCluster Custom Resource server settings. Set the value of `__<property-value>__` to:
[horizontal]
`true`:: To use external {platforms-ingress}.
`false`:: To use internal {orch-name} DNS names.

.Verification steps
. Specify {prod-short} as the default project:

----
$ {orch-cli} project {prod-namespace}
----
. Inspect the ConfigMap properties to determine, which communication method {prod-short} uses. Run the following commands and take note of the output:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes,macros"]
----
$ {orch-cli} get configmap che -o \ 
jsonpath='{.data.pass:[CHE_KEYCLOAK_AUTH__INTERNAL__SERVER__URL]}'
$ {orch-cli} get configmap che -o \ 
jsonpath='{.data.pass:[CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__REGISTRY__INTERNAL__URL]}'
----
* If {prod-short} components communicate externally, the output is empty.
* If {prod-short} components communicate internally, the output is following:
