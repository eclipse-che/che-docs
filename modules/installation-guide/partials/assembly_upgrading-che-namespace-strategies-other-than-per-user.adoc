= Upgrading {prod-short} that uses {orch-namespace} strategies other than 'per user'

This section describes how to upgrade {prod-short} that uses {orch-namespace} strategies other than 'per user'.

{prod-short} intends to use {kubernetes} secrets as a storage for all sensitive user data. One {orch-namespace}
per user simplifies the design of the workspaces. This is the reason why {orch-namespace} strategies other than `per user` become
deprecated. The deprecation process happens in two steps. In the `First Step` {orch-namespace} strategies other than `per user` are allowed but not recommended. In the `Second Step` support for {orch-namespace} strategies other than `per user` is going to be removed.

NOTE: No automated upgrade support exists between `First Step` and `Second Step` for the installations where {orch-namespace}
strategies other than `per user` are used without losing data.

.Prerequisites
 * {prod-short} configured with the {orch-namespace} strategies other than `per user`.
 * Intention to use {prod-short} configured with the `per user` namespace strategies `per user`.
