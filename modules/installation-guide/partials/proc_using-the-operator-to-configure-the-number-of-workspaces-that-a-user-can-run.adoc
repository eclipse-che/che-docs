= Using the Operator to configure the number of workspaces that a user can run

This procedure describes how to configure {prod-short} to run more than one workspace simultaneously. By running multiple workspaces, users can use different work environments simultaneously. 

.Prerequisites
* You have installed an instance of {prod-short} by using the Operator.
* The combination of storage strategy and access mode matches one of the following cases:

|===
| Storage strategy
| `common` (default)
| `per-workspace`
| `unique` 


|`ReadWriteMany` access mode 
| yes
| yes
| yes

| `ReadWriteOnce` access mode
| no
| yes
| yes
|===

** To determine the access modes supported by your storage, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes[Kubernetes documentation - Access Modes]. For example, link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html[Amazon EBS] only supports the `ReadWriteOnce` access mode.
** See xref:configuring-storage-strategies.adoc[]. 

* You have determined the value of the `_<number-of-workspaces>_` placeholder.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the value is `-1`, an unlimited number of workspaces can run per user. If the value is a positive integer, users can run as many workspaces as the value of the integer. The default value is `1`.

.Procedure

* In the `CheCluster` Custom Resource `server` settings, configure the number of workspaces that a user can run by adding the `+CHE_LIMITS_USER_WORKSPACES_RUN_COUNT+` property to `customCheProperties`:
