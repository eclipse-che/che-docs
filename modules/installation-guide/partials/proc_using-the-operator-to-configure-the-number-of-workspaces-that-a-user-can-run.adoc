= Using the Operator to configure the number of workspaces that a user can run

This procedure describes how to configure `{prod-short}` to run more than one workspace simultaneously. By running multiple workspaces, users can use different work environments simultaneously. 

.Prerequisites
* You have installed an instance of `{prod-short}` by using the Operator.
* The combination of PVC strategy and access mode meets the following criteria:
+
.Multiple workspaces compatibility list
|===
| PVC Strategy | `ReadWriteMany` access mode | `ReadWriteOnce` access mode
| `common` (default) | yes | no
| `per-workspace` | yes | yes
| `unique` | yes | yes
|===
+
** To determine the access modes supported by your storage, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes[Kubernetes documentation - Access Modes] 
** To determine the PVC strategy, see xref:configuring-storage-strategies.adoc[].

.Preparing to run multiple workspaces on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
====
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html[Amazon EBS] only supports the `ReadWriteOnce` access mode. Use the `per-workspace` or `unique` PVC strategy.
====

* You have determined the value of the `_<number-of-workspaces>_` placeholder.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the value is `-1`, an unlimited number of workspaces can run per user. If the value is a positive integer, users can run as many workspaces as the value of the integer. The default value is `1`.
====

.Procedure
. In the `CheCluster` Custom Resource `server` settings, configure the number of workspaces that a user can run by adding the `+CHE_LIMITS_USER_WORKSPACES_RUN_COUNT+` property to `customCheProperties`:
