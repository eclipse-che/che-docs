= Understanding the {prod-short} registries

{prod-short} uses two registries: the plug-ins registry and the devfile registry. They are static websites publishing the metadata of {prod-short} plug-ins and devfiles. When built-in offline mode they also include artifacts.

The devfile and plug-in registries run in two separate Pods. Their deployment is part of the {prod-short} installation.

.The devfile and plug-in registries
The devfile registry:: The devfile registry holds the definitions of the {prod-short} stacks. Stacks are available on the {prod-short} user dashboard when selecting *Create Workspace*. It contains the list of {prod-short} technological stack samples with example projects. When built-in offline mode it also contains all sample projects referenced in devfiles as `zip` files.

The plug-in registry:: The plug-in registry makes it possible to share a plug-in definition across all the users of the same instance of {prod-short}. When built-in offline mode it also contains all plug-in or extension artifacts.
