= Using the Operator to configure communication between {prod-short} components

To change between external and internal inter-component communication, update the Custom Resource.

.Prerequisites

* An instance of {prod-short} running on {platforms-name}.
* You have installed {prod-short} by using the Operator.

.Procedure

* Configure the `__<property-value>__` value of the `disableInternalClusterSVCNames` property in the CheCluster Custom Resource server settings. Set the value of `__<property-value>__` to:
[horizontal]
`true`:: To use external {platforms-ingress}.
`false`:: To use internal {orch-name} DNS names.

.Verification steps
  . Navigate to *Workloads* and select *ConfigMaps*.
  . Select `che` and navigate to the *YAML* tab.  
  . Inspect the YAML file to determine, which communication method {prod-short} uses. 
  * To verify that the {prod-short} components communicate externally, ensure that the YAML file does not contain the `+CHE_KEYCLOAK_AUTH__INTERNAL__SERVER__URL+` and `+CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__REGISTRY__INTERNAL__URL+` properties. 
  * To verify that the {prod-short} components communicate internally, ensure that the YAML file contains the `+CHE_KEYCLOAK_AUTH__INTERNAL__SERVER__URL+` and `+CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__REGISTRY__INTERNAL__URL+` properties.
