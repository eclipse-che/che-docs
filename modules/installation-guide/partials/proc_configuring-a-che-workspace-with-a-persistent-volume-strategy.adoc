= Configuring a {prod-short} workspace with a persistent volume strategy

A persistent volume (PV) acts as a virtual storage instance that adds a volume to a cluster.

A persistent volume claim (PVC) is a request to provision persistent storage of a specific type and configuration, available in the following {prod-short} storage configuration strategies:

* Common
* Per-workspace
* Unique

The mounted PVC is displayed as a folder in a container file system.

== Configuring a PVC strategy using the Operator

The following section describes how to configure workspace persistent volume claim (PVC) strategies of a {prod-short} server using the Operator.

WARNING: It is not recommended to reconfigure PVC strategies on an existing {prod-short} cluster with existing workspaces. Doing so causes data loss.

link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/understanding/olm-what-operators-are.html[Operators] are software extensions to {platforms-name} that use link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/understanding/crds/crd-managing-resources-from-crds.html[Custom Resources] to manage applications and their components.

When deploying {prod-short} using the Operator, configure the intended strategy by modifying the `spec.storage.pvcStrategy` property of the CheCluster Custom Resource object YAML file.

.Prerequisites

* The `{orch-cli}` tool is available.

.Procedure

The following procedure steps are available for {platforms-name} command-line tool, {platforms-cli}.

To do changes to the CheCluster YAML file, choose one of the following:

* Create a new cluster by executing the `{orch-cli} apply` command. For example:
+
[subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} apply -f _<my-cluster.yaml>_
----

* Update the YAML file properties of an already running cluster by executing the `{orch-cli} patch` command. For example:
+
[subs="+quotes,+attributes"]
----
$ {orch-cli} patch checluster/{prod-checluster} --type=json \
  -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/storage/pvcStrategy", "value": "per-workspace"}]'
----

Depending on the strategy used, replace the `per-workspace` option in the above example with `unique` or `common`.
