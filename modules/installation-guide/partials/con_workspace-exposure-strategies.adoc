= Workspace exposure strategies

Specific components of workspaces need to be made accessible outside of the {platforms-name} cluster. This is typically the user interface of the workspace's IDE, but it can also be the web UI of the application being developed. This enables developers to interact with the application during the development process.

The supported way of making workspace components available to the users is referred to as a _strategy_. This strategy defines whether new subdomains are created for the workspace components and what hosts these components are available on.

{prod-short} supports:

* `multi-host` strategy
* `single-host` strategy 
** with the `gateway` subtype 
ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]
** with the `native` subtype
* `default-host` strategy

[id="multi-host-workspace-exposure-strategy_{context}"]
== Multi-host strategy

With multi-host strategy, each workspace component is assigned a new subdomain of the main domain configured for the {prod-short} server. This is the default strategy.

This strategy is the easiest to understand from the perspective of component deployment because any paths to the component in the URL are received as they are by the component.

On a {prod-short} server secured using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, creating new subdomains for each component of each workspace requires a wildcard certificate to be available for all such subdomains for the {prod-short} deployment to be practical.

[id="single-host-workspace-exposure-strategy_{context}"]
== Single-host strategy

With single-host strategy, all workspaces are deployed to sub-paths of the main {prod-short} server domain.

This is convenient for TLS-secured {prod-short} servers because it is sufficient to have a single certificate for the {prod-short} server, which will cover all the workspace component deployments as well.

Single-host strategy have two subtypes with different implementation methods. First subtype is named `native`. This strategy is available and default on {kubernetes}, but not on OpenShift, since it uses Ingresses for servers exposing. The second subtype named `gateway`, works both on {platforms-name}, and uses a special Pod with reverse-proxy running inside to route requests.

[WARNING]
====
With `gateway` single-host strategy, cluster network policies has to be configured so that workspace's services are reachable from reverse-proxy Pod (typically in {prod-short} {orch-namespace}). These typically lives in different {orch-namespace}.

To define how to expose the endpoints specified in the devfile, define the `++CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_SINGLEHOST_WORKSPACE_DEVFILE__ENDPOINT__EXPOSURE++` environment variable in the {prod-short} instance. This environment variable is only effective with the single-host server strategy and is applicable to all workspaces of all users.

=== devfile endpoints: `single-host`

`++CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_SINGLEHOST_WORKSPACE_DEVFILE__ENDPOINT__EXPOSURE: 'single-host'++`

This single-host configuration exposes the endpoints on subpaths, for example: `++https://<che-host>/serverihzmuqqc/go-cli-server-8080++`. This limits the exposed components and user applications. Any absolute URL generated on the server side that points back to the server does not work. This is because the server is hidden behind a path-rewriting reverse proxy that hides the unique URL path prefix from the component or user application.

For example, when the user accesses the hypothetical `pass:c,a,q[{prod-url}/component-prefix-djh3d/app/index.php]` URL, the application sees the request coming to `++https://internal-host/app/index.php++`. If the application used the host in the URL that it generates in its UI, it would not work because the internal host is different from the externally visible host. However, if the application used an absolute path as the URL (for the example above, this would be `/app/index.php`), such URL would still not work. This is because on the outside, such URL does not point to the application, because it is missing the component-specific prefix.

Therefore, only applications that use relative URLs in their UI work with the single-host workspace exposure strategy.

=== devfile endpoints: `multi-host`

`++CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_SINGLEHOST_WORKSPACE_DEVFILE__ENDPOINT__EXPOSURE: 'multi-host'++`

This single-host configuration exposes the endpoints on subdomains, for example: `++http://serverihzmuqqc-go-cli-server-8080.<che-host>++`. These endpoints are exposed on an unsecured HTTP port. A dedicated Ingress or Route is used for such endpoints, even with `gateway` single-host setup.

This configuration limits the usability of previews shown directly in the editor page when {prod-short} is configured with TLS. Since `https` pages allow communication only with secured endpoints, users must open their application previews in another browser tab.

ifeval::["{project-context}" == "che"]

[id="default-host-workspace-exposure-strategy_{context}"]
== Default-host strategy

This strategy exposes the components to the outside world on the sub-paths of the default host of the cluster. It is similar to the single-host strategy. All the limitations and advantages of the single-host strategy applying to this strategy as well.
