= Using the Operator to configure the number of workspaces that a user can create 

This procedure describes how to configure the number of workspaces that a user can create. By creating multiple workspaces, users can have access to workspaces with different configurations simultaneously.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed an instance of `{prod-short}` by using the Operator.
* You have determined the value of the `_<number-of-workspaces>_` placeholder.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the value is `-1`, users can create an unlimited number of workspaces. If the value is a positive integer, users can create as many workspaces as the value of the integer. The default value is `-1`.
====

.Procedure

* In the `CheCluster` Custom Resource `server` settings, configure the number of workspaces that a user can create by adding the `+CHE_LIMITS_USER_WORKSPACES_COUNT+` property to `customCheProperties`:
