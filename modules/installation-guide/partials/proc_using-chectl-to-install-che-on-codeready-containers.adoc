= Using {prod-cli} to install {prod-short} on CodeReady Containers 

This section describes how to install {prod-short} on CodeReady Containers (CRC) using `{prod-cli}`.

.Prerequisites

* The `{prod-cli}` management tool is available. See xref:using-the-chectl-management-tool.adoc[].
* An installation of CodeReady Containers. See link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned[Installing CodeReady Containers].
* The path to the user's CRC pull secrete is known.

.Procedure

. Initiate the CRC platform:

.. Configure your host machine for CodeReady Containers:
+
----
$ crc setup
----

.. Remove any previous cluster:
+
----
$ crc delete
----

.. Initiate the `oc` command line interface within CRC: 
+
----
$ eval $(crc oc-env)
----

.. Start the CodeReady Containers virtual machine with at least 12 GB of RAM and specify the path to your pull secret:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ crc start --memory 12288 --pull-secret-file __<download-path>__pull-secret.txt
----

.. Take note of the password for the user `kubeadmin`, displayed at the end of the CRC initiation.

. Log into OpenShift cluster using the `kubeadmin` username, the corresponding `__<kubeadmin-password>__` password, and the CRC URL pointer displayed at the end of the CRC initiation phase:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc login --username="kubeadmin" --password="__<kubeadmin-password>__" https://api.crc.testing:6443

----

. Install the {prod-short} instance using {prod-cli}:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
----
$ {prod-cli} server:deploy --platform crc
----

. Use the Users Dashboard CRC testing URL and sign in as:
+
----
Login: developer
Password: developer
----
+
* For the first time {prod-short} installation, a user needs to import the {prod-short} certificate to the browser of their choice. See, xref:end-user-guide:importing-certificates-to-browsers.adoc[].
+
[NOTE]
====
For a {prod-cli} installation, the browser certificate is copied to the `/tmp/cheCA.crt` folder by the `chectl cacert:export` command during the deployment. This is the same certificate that can be extracted from the User Dashboard of a {prod-short} instance, the export of which is described in the link above, and can be used for the direct browser import.
====

. Enter the user's credentials and start using {prod-short}.
