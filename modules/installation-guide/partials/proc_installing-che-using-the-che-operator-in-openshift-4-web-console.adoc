= Installing {prod-short} using the {prod-short} Operator in OpenShift 4 web console

This section describes how to install {prod-short} using the {prod-short} Operator available in OpenShift 4 web console.

Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a {platforms-name} application which also provide the following:

* Repeatability of installation and upgrade.

* Constant health checks of every system component.

* Over-the-air (OTA) updates for OpenShift components and independent software vendor (ISV) content.

* A place to encapsulate knowledge from field engineers and spread it to all users.




.Prerequisites

* An administrator account on a running instance of OpenShift 4.
