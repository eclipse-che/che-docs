= Configuring communication between {prod-short} components

:context: configuring-communication-between-che-components

To communicate together, {prod-short} components use the internal services names, which are exposed in the internal {platforms-name} network.

The administration can disable the use of the internal services names to force {prod-short} components to use external {platforms-ingress}. Using the external {platforms-ingress} might slow the traffic and lead to issues because it uses proxies, certificates, and firewalls.

Using the external {platforms-ingress} is necessary in the following situations:

* To deploy {prod-short} across multiple {platforms-name} clusters. The internal services names are not shared between distinct clusters.
* To deploy {prod-short} across multiple namespaces. The {orch-name} NetworkPolicies restricts communication between namespaces.

Using internal service names is incompatible with OpenShift clusters configured with the multitenant network plugin. In that case, use external communications.
