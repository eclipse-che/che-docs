When `externalPluginRegistry` is `true`, no such dedicated server will be started by the Operator and you will have to manually set the `pluginRegistryUrl` field.
gitSelfSignedCert: When enabled, the certificate from `che-git-self-signed-cert` ConfigMap will be propagated to the Che components and provide particular configuration for Git.
nonProxyHosts: List of hosts that will be reached directly, bypassing the proxy. Specify wild card domain use the following form `.<DOMAIN>` and `|` as delimiter, for example\: `localhost|.my.host.com|123.42.12.32` Only use when configuring a proxy is required. Operator respects OpenShift cluster wide proxy configuration and no additional configuration is required, but defining `nonProxyHosts` in a custom resource leads to merging non proxy hosts lists from the cluster proxy configuration and ones defined in the custom resources. See the doc https\://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html. See also the `proxyURL` fields.
pluginRegistryCpuLimit: Overrides the CPU limit used in the plugin registry deployment. In cores. (500m = .5 cores). Default to 500m.

proxyURL: URL (protocol+host name) of the proxy server. This drives the appropriate changes in the `JAVA_OPTS` and `https(s)_proxy` variables in the Che server and workspaces containers. Only use when configuring a proxy is required. Operator respects OpenShift cluster wide proxy configuration and no additional configuration is required, but defining `proxyUrl` in a custom resource leads to overrides the cluster proxy configuration with fields `proxyUrl`, `proxyPort`, `proxyUser` and `proxyPassword` from the custom resource. See the doc https\://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html. See also the `proxyPort` and `nonProxyHosts` fields.
proxyUser: User name of the proxy server. Only use when configuring a proxy is required. See also the `proxyURL`, `proxyPassword` and `proxySecret` fields.
selfSignedCert: Deprecated. The value of this flag is ignored. The Che Operator will automatically detect whether the router certificate is self-signed and propagate it to other components, such as the Che server.

serverExposureStrategy: Sets the server and workspaces exposure type. Possible values are `multi-host`, `single-host`, `default-host`. Defaults to `multi-host`, which creates a separate ingress, or OpenShift routes, for every required endpoint. `single-host` makes Che exposed on a single host name with workspaces exposed on subpaths. Read the docs to learn about the limitations of this approach. Also consult the `singleHostExposureType` property to further configure how the Operator and the Che server make that happen on Kubernetes. `default-host` exposes the Che server on the host of the cluster. Read the docs to learn about the limitations of this approach.

serverMemoryRequest: Overrides the memory request used in the Che server deployment. Defaults to 512Mi.
serverTrustStoreConfigMapName: Name of the ConfigMap with public certificates to add to Java trust store of the Che server. This is often required when adding the OpenShift OAuth provider, which has HTTPS endpoint signed with self-signed cert. The Che server must be aware of its CA cert to be able to request it. This is disabled by default.
singleHostGatewayConfigMapLabels: The labels that need to be present in the ConfigMaps representing the gateway configuration.
singleHostGatewayConfigSidecarImage: The image used for the gateway sidecar that provides configuration to the gateway. Omit it or leave it empty to use the default container image provided by the Operator.
singleHostGatewayImage: The image used for the gateway in the single host mode. Omit it or leave it empty to use the default container image provided by the Operator.
