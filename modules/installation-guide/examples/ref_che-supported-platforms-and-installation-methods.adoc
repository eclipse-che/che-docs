It is possible to use the `{prod-cli}` utility for deploying {prod-short} on {ocp} version 4.3 and 4.4. This method is considered unofficial and serves as a backup installation method for situations where installation using OperatorHub is not available.

////
Starting with the {prod-short} version 7.14, the `{prod-cli}` acts as secondary supported and official installation method that serves also as an backup installation method for situations where the installation method using OperatorHub is not available.
