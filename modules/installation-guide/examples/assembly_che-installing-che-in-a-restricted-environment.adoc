= Installing {prod-short} in a restricted environment

:context: installing-{prod-id-short}-in-a-restricted-environment

By default, {prod-short} workspaces reference various external resources, including container images available in public registries or sample projects hosted on public resources. This section describes how to deploy {prod-short} in a restricted environment where these external resources are not available. This method is also called _offline mode_ or _air-gap scenario_.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the cluster using the developer account.

* Dynamic provisioning or pre-defined PVs configured before the deployment.

* Block-based storage volume or NFS share available outside of the cluster to serve dynamic storage provisioning or PVs. Block-based storage is recommended for optimal performance.
