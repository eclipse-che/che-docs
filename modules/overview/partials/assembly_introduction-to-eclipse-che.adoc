== What is {prod}

{prod} is a {kubernetes}-native IDE and developer collaboration platform.

As an open source project, the core goals of {prod} are to:

* *Accelerate project and developer onboarding:* As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, {prod} makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* *Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:* As {prod} becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, {prod} provides:

* *Workspaces:* Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* *Browser-based IDEs:* Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tools, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more.
* *Extensible platform:* Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* *Enterprise Integration:* Multiuser capabilities, including {identity-provider} for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD.

=== Workspace model

{prod-short} defines the workspace to be the project code files and all the dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. {prod-short} treats the IDE and the development runtime as dependencies of the workspace. These items are embedded and always included with the workspace. This differentiates {prod-short} from classical workspace definitions, which may include the project code, but require the developer to bind their IDE to their workstation and use it to provide a runtime locally.

Workspaces are isolated from one another and are responsible for managing the lifecycle of their components.

Developers using {prod} use their containers directly in their developer workspaces. *{prod-short} workspaces are {platforms-name} Pods, which allow to replicate the application runtimes (and its microservices) used in production* and provide a “developer mode” layer on top of those, adding intelligent code completion and IDE tools.

=== Browser-based IDEs

{prod} provides browser-based IDEs for its workspaces. The default IDE is built on link:https://github.com/theia-ide/theia[Theia], and it has the following capabilities:

* *Monaco-based editor:* A fast and responsive editor, CodeLens
* **Language Server Protocol:** Language tools
* *Debug Adapter Protocol:* Debugger tools
* *Command palette:* Do everything from your keyboard
* *Task support:* Tasks from Visual Studio Code are extended and support {prod-short} commands
* *Embedded preview:* Preview your application directly from the IDE, including Markdown preview
* *Customizable layout:* Adapt the layout using drag-and-drop
* *And more:* Outline view, search, Git


==== Different IDEs for different use cases


In {prod}, the IDE is completely decoupled, so that it is possible to plug a different IDE into {prod-short} workspaces:

* It can be based on Eclipse Theia (as it is a framework to build a web IDE), such as Sirius:

* It can be a completely different solution, such as Jupyter or Eclipse Dirigible:
+

For situations where the default IDE does not cover the use cases of the users or to use a dedicated tool rather than an IDE.


=== Extensible platform

{prod} is a great platform to build cloud-native tools, and it provides a strong extensibility model with an enjoyable developer experience for contributors.

{prod} is extensible in different ways:

* *Plug-ins* to add capabilities to the IDE. Che-Theia plug-ins rely on APIs compatible with Visual Studio Code. Plug-ins are isolated and provide their own dependencies packaged in containers.
* *Stacks* to create pre-configured {prod-short} workspaces with a dedicated set of tools.
* *Alternative IDEs* to provide specialized tools within {prod}. Build your own, based on Eclipse Theia, or pick existing ones such as Jupyter.
* *Marketplace (soon)* to easily distribute tools and custom IDEs, which can be tried online, to users and communities.

{prod} uses Che-Theia as its default browser-based IDE. Che-Theia provides a framework to build web IDEs. It is built-in TypeScript and gives contributors a programming model that is flexible, relies on state-of-the-art tools protocols, and makes it faster to build new tools.

In {prod}, the dependencies needed for the tools running in the user's workspace are available when needed. This means that a Che-Theia plug-in provides its dependencies, its back-end services (which could be running in a sidecar container connected to the user’s workspace), and the IDE UI extension. {prod-short} packages all these elements together, so that the user does not have to configure different tools together.

==== Visual Studio Code extension compatibility

{prod} rationalizes the effort for a contributor who wants to build a plug-in and distribute it to different developer communities and tools. For that purpose, {prod} features a plug-in API compatible with extension points from Visual Studio Code. As a result, it is easy to bring an existing plug-in from Visual Studio Code into {prod}. The main difference is in the way the plug-ins are packaged. On {prod}, plug-ins are delivered with their own dependencies in their own container.

=== Enterprise integration

* {prod} includes link:{identity-provider-url}[{identity-provider}] to handle authentication and security. It allows integration with any single sign-on (SSO), and with Active Directory or LDAP.

* Every {prod} user gets a centralized developer workspace that can be easily defined, administered, and managed.

* As a {kubernetes}-native application, {prod} provides state-of-the-art monitoring and tracing capabilities, integrating with link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] and link:https://grafana.com/[Grafana].
