= Introduction to {prod}


* A centralized developer environment running on {platforms-name}.
* A multi-container workspace for each developer with the ability to replicate with a single click using {prod} factories.
* Pre-built stacks with the ability to create custom stacks for any language or runtime.
* An enterprise integration using OpenShift OAuth or Dex.
* Browser-based IDEs; integration with link:https://github.com/che-incubator/che-code[Microsoft Visual Studio Code - Open Source] and others such as link:https://github.com/che-incubator/jetbrains-editor-images[JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition].
* Support of tools protocols, such as the Language Server Protocol or Debug Adapter Protocol.
* A plugin mechanism compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* A software development kit (SDK) for creating custom cloud developer platforms.

== What is {prod}

{prod} is a {kubernetes}-native IDE and developer collaboration platform.

As an open source project, the core goals of {prod} are to:

* *Accelerate project and developer onboarding:* As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, {prod} makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* *Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:* As {prod} becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, {prod} provides:

* *Workspaces:* Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* *Browser-based IDEs:* Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tools, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more.
* *Extensible platform:* Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plugins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* *Enterprise Integration:* Multiuser capabilities with OIDC authentication.

=== Workspace model

{prod-short} defines the workspace to be the project code files and all the dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. {prod-short} treats the IDE and the development runtime as dependencies of the workspace. These items are embedded and always included with the workspace. This differentiates {prod-short} from classical workspace definitions, which can include the project code, but require the developer to bind their IDE to their workstation and use it to provide a runtime locally.

Workspaces are isolated from one another and are responsible for managing the lifecycle of their components.

Developers using {prod} use their containers directly in their developer workspaces. *{prod-short} workspaces are {platforms-name} Pods, which allow to replicate the application runtimes (and its microservices) used in production* and provide a “developer mode” layer on top of those, adding intelligent code completion and IDE tools.

=== Enterprise integration

* An enterprise integration using OpenShift OAuth or Dex.
* Every {prod} user gets a centralized developer workspace that can be easily defined, administered, and managed.

* As a {kubernetes}-native application, {prod} provides state-of-the-art monitoring and tracing capabilities, integrating with link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] and link:https://grafana.com/[Grafana].
