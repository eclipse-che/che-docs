Each user is granted permissions only to their namespace, and can not access other user’s resources.
Cluster administrators can add extra permissions to users.
They should not remove permissions granted by default.
Refer to the link:https://eclipse.dev/che/docs/stable/administration-guide/configuring-cluster-roles-for-users/[product documentation] for configuring cluster roles for {prod} users.
More details about the role-based access control are available in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/authentication/using-rbac.html[OpenShift documentation].
